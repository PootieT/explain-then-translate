You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease. Can you explain what this Python program does with a couple of sentences? The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++?

### Python version

def even_odd_palindrome(n: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    def is_palindrome(n):
        return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

    even_palindrome_count = 0
    odd_palindrome_count = 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i%2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i):
                odd_palindrome_count += 1
        elif i%2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i):
            even_palindrome_count += 1
    return (even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)

### Explanation

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. The first integer is the count of even palindromes between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and the second integer is the count of odd palindromes between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The function `is_palindrome` checks if a given number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it to its reverse.

The function then initializes two counters, `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`, to zero. It then loops through all numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and checks if each number is a palindrome and even or odd. If the number is a palindrome and odd, it increments `odd_palindrome_count`. If the number is a palindrome and even, it increments `even_palindrome_count`.

To rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the type annotations with the appropriate C++ types, and use a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers between 1 and `n`. You would also need to write a function to check if a number is a palindrome, which could be done by converting the number to a string and comparing it to its reverse. Finally, you would need to declare and initialize two counters for even and odd palindromes, and increment them appropriately within the loop. The final result would be a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a pair of integers representing the count of even and odd palindromes between 1 and `n`.
