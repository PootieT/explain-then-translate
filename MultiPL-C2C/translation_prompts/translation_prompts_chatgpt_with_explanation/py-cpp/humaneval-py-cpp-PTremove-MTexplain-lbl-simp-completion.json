The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    depth = 0\n    for b in brackets:\n        if b == \"(\":\n            depth += 1\n        else:\n            depth -= 1\n        if depth < 0:\n            return False\n    return depth == 0\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `correct_bracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced. \n\nThe function works by iterating over each character in the string of brackets. For each character, if it is an opening bracket (i.e. \"(\"), the `depth` variable is incremented by 1. If it is a closing bracket (i.e. \")\"), the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. If the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function immediately returns `False`. \n\nAfter iterating over all the characters in the string, the function checks whether the `depth` variable is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. If it is not, it means that there are still opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `False`.\n\nThe function takes a single argument, `brackets`, which is a string of brackets. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced. The function is defined using Python's function definition syntax, which starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name (`correct_bracketing`), and the function's parameters (`brackets: str`). The `-> bool` syntax indicates that the function returns a boolean value. \n\nThe `depth` variable is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. The loop iterates over each character in the `brackets` string using a `for` loop. The `if` statement checks whether the current character is an opening bracket (`(`). If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1 using the `+=` operator. If the current character is a closing bracket (`)`), the `depth` variable is decremented by 1 using the `-=` operator. The `if` statement inside the loop checks whether the `depth` variable is negative. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`. \n\nAfter the loop finishes, the function checks whether the `depth` variable is equal to 0 using the `==` operator. If it is, the function returns `True`. If it is not, the function returns `False`. \n\nOverall, the function checks whether a string of brackets is correctly balanced by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets seen so far. If the number of closing brackets ever exceeds the number of opening brackets, the function returns `False`. If the number of opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket is greater than 0, the function also returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"

In this implementation, the sequence starts with 0, 0, 2, 0.\n\n`def fib4(n: int) -> int:` - This is a function definition that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.

If it is, the function returns the value of `results[n]`.

The function returns the maximum number of containers required to fill the grid such that each container can hold at most `capacity` units of the grid. \n\nThe function first imports the `math` module and the `List` type from the `typing` module. \n\n`math` module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. \n\n`List` is a type hint that indicates that the variable is a list of integers. \n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword followed by the function name `max_fill`. The function takes two arguments, `grid` and `capacity`, and returns an integer. \n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that uses a list comprehension to calculate the maximum number of containers required to fill the grid. \n\nThe list comprehension iterates over each list `arr` in the `grid` and calculates the sum of the elements in the list. The `sum` function returns the sum of all the elements in the list. \n\nThe `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result of the division of the sum of the elements in the list by the `capacity`. This is done to ensure that each container can hold at most `capacity` units of the grid. \n\nThe `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the rounded up values for each list in the `grid`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of all the rounded up values, which is the maximum number of containers required to fill the grid.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong max_fill(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long capacity) {\n"

The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the value of each element.\n\n5. `if idx != idx2:` - This line checks if the current index of the outer loop is not equal to the current index of the inner loop. This is to ensure that we are not comparing an element to itself.\n\n6. `distance = abs(elem - elem2)` - This line calculates the absolute difference between the two elements being compared.\n\n7. `if distance < threshold:` - This line checks if the calculated distance is less than the threshold value.\n\n8. `return True` - This line returns `True` if the distance between any two elements is less than the threshold.\n\n9. `return False` - This line returns `False` if no two elements in the list are closer than the threshold. This line is outside the nested loop, so it is only executed after all possible pairs of elements have been compared.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n"

The `-> int` part specifies that the function should return an integer.\n\n`return len(set(string.lower()))`\n\nThis line returns the length of a set of the lowercased characters in the input string. The `string.lower()` part converts the input string to lowercase, and the `set()` function creates a set of the characters in the string. Since sets only contain unique elements, this effectively removes any duplicates from the string. Finally, the `len()` function returns the number of elements in the resulting set, which is the number of distinct characters in the input string.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong count_distinct_characters(std::string string) {\n"

The function returns an empty tuple if either of the planets is not in the list of planet names or if the two planets are the same.\n\nThe function defines a tuple of planet names `planet_names` and checks if `planet1` and `planet2` are in the `planet_names` tuple and not the same. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an empty tuple.\n\nThe function then gets the index of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planet_names` tuple using the `index` method. If `planet1` comes before `planet2` in the tuple, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple from the index of `planet1` plus one to the index of `planet2`. If `planet2` comes before `planet1`, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple from the index of `planet2` plus one to the index of `planet1`.\n\nThe function uses the `typing` module to specify the return type of the function as a tuple of strings. The `Tuple` type is used to specify the type of the tuple and the `...` syntax is used to indicate that the tuple can have any number of elements.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> bf(std::string planet1, std::string planet2) {\n"

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. For example, \"racecar\" is a palindrome.\n\nThe first line imports the List class from the typing module.

This variable will be used to keep track of the number of changes required to make the list a palindrome.\n\nThe fourth line starts a for loop which iterates over the first half of the list. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `len(arr) // 2 - 1`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means that the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, `5 // 2` is equal to 2.\n\nThe fifth line checks if the element at index `i` is not equal to the element at index `len(arr) - i - 1`. If they are not equal, it means that a change is required to make the list a palindrome. The `len` function returns the length of the list, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is used to access the element at the corresponding index on the other half of the list.\n\nThe sixth line increments the `ans` variable by 1 if a change is required.\n\nThe seventh line returns the final value of `ans`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong smallest_change(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

If `i` is prime, the function iterates over all integers between 2 and 100 (inclusive) using another `for` loop. For each integer `j`, the function checks whether `j` is prime using the `is_prime` function. If `j` is not prime, the loop continues to the next integer.

If `k` is prime, the function checks whether the product of `i`, `j`, and `k` is equal to `a`. If the product is equal to `a`, the function returns `True`. \n\nIf the function has iterated over all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k` without finding a product equal to `a`, the function returns `False`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_multiply_prime(long a) {\n"

The function first defines an inner function called `isPrime` that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is prime or not. \n\nThe `isPrime` function works by iterating over all integers from 2 to the square root of the input integer. If any of these integers divides the input integer without a remainder, then the input integer is not prime and the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, then the input integer is prime and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe outer function then initializes two variables: `maxx` and `i`. `maxx` is set to 0 and `i` is set to 0. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the input list. \n\nInside the while loop, the function checks whether the current element of the input list is greater than `maxx` and whether it is prime by calling the `isPrime` function. If both conditions are true, then `maxx` is set to the current element of the input list. The loop then increments `i` by 1 and continues to the next iteration.\n\nAfter the while loop completes, the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` by converting it to a string and then iterating over each character in the string and converting it to an integer. The sum of these integers is then returned as the result of the function.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong skjkasdkd(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The output of the function is also a string, which is specified using the `->` syntax.\n\nThe first line of the function creates a string called `vowels` that contains all the vowels in both uppercase and lowercase. \n\nThe second line creates a dictionary called `vowels_replace` that maps each vowel in `vowels` to the next character in the ASCII table. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each character in `vowels`, and creates a tuple with the original character and the character that comes two positions after it in the ASCII table. The `dict()` function is then used to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary.\n\nThe third line of the function uses the `swapcase()` method to swap the case of all characters in the `message` string. This means that all uppercase letters will become lowercase, and all lowercase letters will become uppercase.\n\nThe fourth line of the function creates a new string by iterating over each character in the `message` string, and replacing it with the corresponding value in the `vowels_replace` dictionary if the character is a vowel, or leaving it unchanged if it is not a vowel. This is done using a list comprehension that creates a list of characters, and then joins them together into a single string using the `join()` method.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encode(std::string message) {\n"

The function first imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. The `List` class is a generic type that represents a list of items of a certain type. In this case, the type is `str`, which means that the list contains strings.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `sorted_list_sum`.

The function counts the number of even and odd palindromic numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and returns the counts as a tuple.\n\nThe function has an inner function called `is_palindrome` that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. The function converts the integer to a string and checks if the string is equal to its reverse.\n\nThe function initializes two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to zero. These variables will be used to count the number of even and odd palindromic numbers respectively.\n\nThe function then loops through the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop. For each integer `i` in the range, the function checks if `i` is odd and a palindrome. If it is, the `odd_palindrome_count` variable is incremented by 1. If `i` is even and a palindrome, the `even_palindrome_count` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of the two counts `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n"

The function takes in three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` and returns a float value representing the area of the triangle. \n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n```\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `triangle_area`. The function takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns a float value. The `->` symbol is used to indicate the return type of the function.\n\n```python\nif a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n    return -1 \n```\nThe first line of the function checks if the input values can form a valid triangle. If the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side, then the input values cannot form a triangle. In this case, the function returns -1 to indicate that the input is invalid.\n\n```python\ns = (a + b + c)/2    \n```\nIf the input values can form a valid triangle, the function calculates the semi-perimeter `s` of the triangle using the formula `(a + b + c)/2`. The semi-perimeter is used in the next line to calculate the area of the triangle.\n\n```python\narea = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5\n```\nThe area of the triangle is calculated using Heron's formula, which is given by `sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`. The formula calculates the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides. \n\n```python\narea = round(area, 2)\n```\nThe area of the triangle is rounded to two decimal places using the `round()` function.\n\n```python\nreturn area\n```\nFinally, the function returns the calculated area of the triangle.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long b, long c) {\n"

The function takes a dictionary as an argument and returns a boolean value.\n\nThe function starts by importing the `Dict` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the argument passed to the function.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\n```\n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `check_dict_case`, and the argument `dict` which is of type `Dict[str, str]`. The `-> bool` specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\n```python\ndef check_dict_case(dict: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:\n```\n\nThe function checks if the dictionary is empty. If it is, the function returns `False`.\n\n```python\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n```\n\nIf the dictionary is not empty, the function initializes a variable `state` to `\"start\"`. The variable `state` is used to keep track of the case of the keys in the dictionary.\n\n```python\n    else:\n        state = \"start\"\n```\n\nThe function then iterates over the keys in the dictionary using a `for` loop.\n\n```python\n        for key in dict.keys():\n```\n\nFor each key, the function checks if it is a string. If it is not a string, the variable `state` is set to `\"mixed\"` and the loop is broken.\n\n```python\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = \"mixed\"\n                break\n```\n\nIf the key is a string, the function checks the case of the key. If the variable `state` is `\"start\"`, the function checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase. If the key is uppercase, the variable `state` is set to `\"upper\"`. If the key is lowercase, the variable `state` is set to `\"lower\"`. If the key is neither uppercase nor lowercase, the loop is broken.\n\n```python\n            if state == \"start\":\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = \"upper\"\n                elif key.islower():\n                    state = \"lower\"\n                else:\n                    break\n```\n\nIf the variable `state` is not `\"start\"`, the function checks if the case of the key matches the case of the previous keys. If the case does not match, the variable `state` is set to `\"mixed\"` and the loop is broken.\n\n```python\n            elif (state == \"upper\" and not key.isupper()) or (state == \"lower\" and not key.islower()):\n                    state = \"mixed\"\n                    break\n```\n\nIf the case of the key matches the case of the previous keys, the loop continues.\n\n```python\n            else:\n                continue\n```\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function checks if the variable `state` is `\"upper\"` or `\"lower\"`. If it is, the function returns `True`. If it is not, the function returns `False`.\n\n```python\n        return state == \"upper\" or state == \"lower\"\n```\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool check_dict_case(std::map<std::string,std::string> dict) {\n"

The sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of all the natural numbers from 1 up to that number. For example, the first 5 numbers in the sequence are 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15.\n\nThe function `tri` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` numbers from the Triangular Number Sequence. \n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the output of the `tri` function.\n\nThe `tri` function starts with an `if` statement that checks if the input `n` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns a list with a single element, 1. This is because the first number in the Triangular Number Sequence is always 1.\n\nIf `n` is not 0, the function creates a list called `my_tri` with the first two numbers of the sequence, 1 and 3.\n\nThe function then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). \n\nInside the loop, the function checks if the current iteration number `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the function appends `(i / 2) + 1` to the `my_tri` list. This is because the formula for the `i`th even number in the sequence is `(i / 2) * (i + 1)`. \n\nIf `i` is odd, the function appends the sum of the previous two numbers in the `my_tri` list, plus `(i + 3) / 2`. This is because the formula for the `i`th odd number in the sequence is `((i + 1) / 2) * (i + 2)`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `my_tri` list.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> tri(long n) {\n"

The sorting is done based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer in the array. \n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the input and output of the `sort_array` function. \n\nThe second line defines the `sort_array` function. It takes in an array of integers `arr` and returns a sorted version of the array. \n\nThe third line of the function sorts the input array `arr` using the `sorted` function. This sorts the array in ascending order. \n\nThe fourth line sorts the array again using the `sorted` function. This time, the sorting is based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer in the array. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is used to specify the sorting criteria. The `lambda` function `lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1')` is used as the sorting key. \n\nThe `lambda` function takes an integer `x`, converts it to its binary representation using the `bin` function, removes the first two characters of the binary representation (which are '0b'), and then counts the number of '1's in the remaining string using the `count` method. This count is used as the sorting criteria for the `sorted` function. \n\nThe sorted array is then returned as the output of the `sort_array` function.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_array(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

This variable will be used to keep track of the current sum of the contiguous subarray being considered.\n\nThe fifth line starts a loop that iterates over each element `num` in the `nums` list.\n\nThe sixth line subtracts `num` from `s` and assigns the result back to `s`. This is equivalent to adding `-num` to `s`. \n\nThe seventh line checks if `s` is less than 0. If it is, then `s` is set to 0. This is because if the current sum of the contiguous subarray being considered is negative, then it is better to start over with a new subarray that has a positive sum.\n\nThe eighth line updates `max_sum` to be the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`. This is because `s` is the current sum of the contiguous subarray being considered, and `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray seen so far.\n\nThe ninth line checks if `max_sum` is 0.

If a line is too long or too complicated, simplify it and explain what individual parts of the line mean first before explaining the whole line. The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef get_odd_collatz(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    if n%2==0:\n        odd_collatz = [] \n    else:\n        odd_collatz = [n]\n    while n > 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n/2\n        else:\n            n = n*3 + 1\n            \n        if n%2 == 1:\n            odd_collatz.append(int(n))\n\n    return sorted(odd_collatz)\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of the Collatz conjecture. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe function `get_odd_collatz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of odd numbers that are generated by the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, an empty list `odd_collatz` is created. If `n` is odd, a list `odd_collatz` is created with `n` as its only element. \n\nThe function then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. In each iteration of the loop, the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, `n` is divided by 2. If `n` is odd, `n` is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to the result. If the resulting number is odd, it is appended to the `odd_collatz` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `odd_collatz` list sorted in ascending order. \n\nThe `typing` module is imported at the beginning of the code to allow type hints to be used in the function signature. The `List` type hint indicates that the function returns a list of integers. The `int` type hint indicates that the input parameter `n` is an integer. \n\nThe `sorted` function is used to sort the `odd_collatz` list in ascending order before it is returned.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> get_odd_collatz(long n) {\n"

The function first imports the `math` module. \n\nThe function `is_prime` is defined within `prime_fib`. It takes an integer `p` and returns `True` if `p` is prime, and `False` otherwise. If `p` is less than 2, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function checks if `p` is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `p`, inclusive. If `p` is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`. If `p` is not divisible by any of these integers, it is prime, so the function returns `True`.\n\nThe function initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two numbers, 0 and 1, in a list `f`. It then enters a loop that appends the sum of the last two numbers in `f` to `f`. If the last number in `f` is prime, `n` is decremented. If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the last number in `f`. \n\nOverall, the function generates the Fibonacci sequence and checks if each number in the sequence is prime until it reaches the `n`th prime number in the sequence. The function then returns that prime number.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong prime_fib(long n) {\n"

The tuples are sorted first by row (ascending) and then by column (descending).\n\n- `from typing import List` and `from typing import Tuple` import the `List` and `Tuple` types from the `typing` module. These types are used to specify the types of the function arguments and return value.\n- `def get_row(lst: List[List[int]], x: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:` defines the function `get_row` that takes a 2D list of integers `lst` and an integer `x` as input and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of all occurrences of `x` in `lst`. The function signature specifies the types of the arguments and return value.\n- `coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]` creates a list of tuples representing the coordinates of all occurrences of `x` in `lst`. The list comprehension iterates over all rows and columns of `lst` and filters out the coordinates where the value at that position is equal to `x`.\n- `return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])` sorts the list of tuples first by column (descending) and then by row (ascending) and returns the sorted list. The `sorted` function takes a list and a `key` function that specifies the sorting order. The `key` function is a lambda function that extracts the row or column index from each tuple. The `reverse` parameter is set to `True` to sort the columns in descending order. The outer `sorted` function sorts the list of tuples by row index.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::tuple<long, long>> get_row(std::vector<std::vector<long>> lst, long x) {\n"

If it is, then the `running_max` variable is set to the current element `n`.\n\nThe seventh line of the code is an `else` statement that is executed if the `running_max` variable is not `None`. In this case, the `running_max` variable is set to the maximum value between the current `running_max` value and the current element `n`.\n\nThe eighth line of the code appends the current `running_max` value to the `result` list.\n\nThe ninth line of the code returns the `result` list, which contains the rolling maximum values of the input list.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> rolling_max(std::vector<long> numbers) {\n"

The function is defined with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, `do_algebra`, and the input arguments enclosed in parentheses. The `->` symbol is used to indicate the return type of the function, which is `int`.\n\nThe first line of the function imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to indicate that the `operator` and `operand` arguments are lists.\n\nThe second line of the function initializes a variable `expression` to a string representation of the first element of the `operand` list.\n\nThe third line of the function starts a `for` loop that iterates over the `operator` and `operand` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function. The `zip` function returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the input iterables. In this case, it aggregates the elements of `operator` and `operand[1:]`, which is a slice of the `operand` list starting from the second element. This is done to match the number of operators with the number of operands.\n\nThe fourth line of the function concatenates the current operator and operand to the `expression` variable using the `+=` operator. The `str` function is used to convert the operand to a string before concatenation.\n\nThe fifth line of the function uses the `eval` function to evaluate the `expression` string as a Python expression and return the result as an integer. The `eval` function takes a string as input and evaluates it as a Python expression. In this case, the expression is a string representation of a mathematical expression, such as \"2+3*4\", which is evaluated to 14. The `eval` function is a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous if used improperly, as it can execute arbitrary code. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only with trusted input.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong do_algebra(std::vector<std::string> op, std::vector<long> operand) {\n"

If a line is too long or too complicated, simplify it and explain what individual parts of the line mean first before explaining the whole line. The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:\n    return set(s0) == set(s1)\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function named `same_chars` that takes two string arguments, `s0` and `s1`, and returns a boolean value. The function returns `True` if the two strings have the same characters, regardless of order. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe function uses the `set` data type to compare the characters in the two strings. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. The `set` function takes a string as input and returns a set of the unique characters in the string. If the sets of the two input strings are equal, then the two strings have the same characters.\n\nThe `-> bool` syntax after the function signature indicates that the function returns a boolean value. This is a type hint, which is a way to indicate the expected types of the function's arguments and return value. Type hints are not enforced by the Python interpreter, but they can be used by tools like linters and IDEs to provide better code analysis and autocomplete suggestions.\n\nThe `def` keyword is used to define a function in Python. The function name is `same_chars`, and it takes two arguments, `s0` and `s1`, both of which are of type `str`. The `:` after the argument list indicates the start of the function body.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that uses the `set` function to compare the characters in the two input strings. The `==` operator is used to compare the sets for equality, and the result is returned by the function using the `return` keyword.\n\nOverall, the function is a concise and efficient way to check if two strings have the same characters, regardless of order. It uses the built-in `set` function to perform the comparison, which takes advantage of the set's unique element property to eliminate duplicates and order dependence.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool same_chars(std::string s0, std::string s1) {\n"

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\ndef file_name_check(file_name: str) -> str:\n    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')\n    if len(lst) != 2:\n        return 'No'\n    if not lst[1] in suf:\n        return 'No'\n    if len(lst[0]) == 0:\n        return 'No'\n    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():\n        return 'No'\n    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])\n    if t > 3:\n        return 'No'\n    return 'Yes'\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `file_name_check` that takes a string as an argument and returns a string. The function checks if the input string is a valid file name. \n\n1. `def file_name_check(file_name: str) -> str:` - This line defines the function `file_name_check` that takes a string argument `file_name` and returns a string. The `-> str` is a type hint that specifies the return type of the function.\n\n2. `suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']` - This line creates a list `suf` that contains three strings: `'txt'`, `'exe'`, and `'dll'`. These are the allowed file extensions.\n\n3. `lst = file_name.split(sep='.')` - This line splits the input string `file_name` into a list `lst` using the period (`.`) as a separator.\n\n4. `if len(lst) != 2:` - This line checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. If it is not, it means that the input string does not have exactly one period, so it is not a valid file name. The function returns `'No'`.\n\n5. `if not lst[1] in suf:` - This line checks if the second element of `lst` (which should be the file extension) is not in the list of allowed file extensions `suf`. If it is not, it means that the file extension is not allowed, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n6. `if len(lst[0]) == 0:` - This line checks if the length of the first element of `lst` (which should be the file name) is zero. If it is, it means that the file name is empty, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n7. `if not lst[0][0].isalpha():` - This line checks if the first character of the first element of `lst` (which should be the first character of the file name) is not an alphabetic character. If it is not, it means that the file name does not start with an alphabetic character, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n8. `t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])` - This line creates a list of all the digits in the first element of `lst` and assigns the length of that list to the variable `t`.\n\n9. `if t > 3:` - This line checks if the number of digits in the file name is greater than 3. If it is, it means that the file name has too many digits, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n10. `return 'Yes'` - This line is reached if all the previous checks have passed, which means that the input string is a valid file name. The function returns `'Yes'`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string file_name_check(std::string file_name) {\n"

If there are multiple strings with the same number of unique characters, the function returns the lexicographically smallest string.\n\nThe function is defined with the name `find_max` and takes a single argument `words`, which is a list of strings. The function returns a single string.\n\nThe first line of the function imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `words` argument.\n\nThe second line of the function defines the function signature. The function takes a list of strings as input and returns a string. The `->` symbol is used to specify the return type.\n\nThe third line of the function sorts the input list of strings using the `sorted` function. The `key` argument is used to specify the sorting criteria. The sorting criteria is a lambda function that takes a single argument `x` and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the negative length of the set of unique characters in the string `x`. The negative sign is used to sort the list in descending order of the length of the set of unique characters. The second element of the tuple is the string `x` itself. This is used to break ties in case there are multiple strings with the same number of unique characters.\n\nThe fourth line of the function returns the first element of the sorted list, which is the string with the maximum number of unique characters.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string find_max(std::vector<std::string> words) {\n"

The `number` variable is then updated to the remainder of the integer division of `number` and the current value in the `num` list, and the process is repeated until `number` is equal to 0. The resulting string is then returned in lowercase.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string int_to_mini_roman(long number) {\n"

The third line creates a copy of the input list using the `list()` constructor. This is done to avoid modifying the original list.\n4. The fourth line sorts every third element of the list in ascending order. This is done using Python's slice notation `l[::3]` which selects every third element of the list. The `sorted()` function is then called on this slice to sort it in ascending order. The sorted slice is then assigned back to the original list using slice notation `l[::3] = ...`.\n5. The fifth line returns the sorted list.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_third(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

If a line is too long or too complicated, simplify it and explain what individual parts of the line mean first before explaining the whole line. The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\ndef simplify(x: str, n: str) -> bool:\n    a, b = x.split(\"/\")\n    c, d = n.split(\"/\")\n    numerator = int(a) * int(c)\n    denom = int(b) * int(d)\n    if (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)):\n        return True\n    return False\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `simplify` that takes two strings as input and returns a boolean. The function is defined with two arguments `x` and `n`, both of which are of type `str`. The function returns a boolean value that is either `True` or `False`. \n\nThe first line of the function definition specifies the types of the input arguments and the return value. The `->` operator is used to specify the return type of the function. In this case, the function takes two arguments, both of which are strings, and returns a boolean value.\n\nThe second line of the function definition unpacks the two input strings `x` and `n` into two variables `a` and `b`, and `c` and `d` respectively. The `split()` method is used to split the strings at the `/` character and assign the resulting substrings to the variables.\n\nThe third line of the function definition calculates the numerator of a fraction by multiplying the integer values of `a` and `c`. The fourth line calculates the denominator of the fraction by multiplying the integer values of `b` and `d`.\n\nThe fifth line of the function definition checks if the numerator divided by the denominator is equal to the integer value of the numerator divided by the denominator. If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nIn summary, the `simplify` function takes two strings that represent fractions, calculates the product of the two fractions, and checks if the result can be simplified to an integer. If the result can be simplified to an integer, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool simplify(std::string x, std::string n) {\n"

The function is defined with the input argument `s` of type string and the output argument of type string. \n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables `flg` and `idx` to 0 and creating a new list `new_str` which is a copy of the input string `s`. \n\nThe function then iterates through each character in the input string `s` using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if it is an alphabet using the `isalpha()` method. If the character is an alphabet, it swaps the case of the character using the `swapcase()` method and stores the result in the corresponding position in the `new_str` list. It also sets the `flg` variable to 1 to indicate that at least one alphabet was found in the input string. The `idx` variable is incremented to keep track of the current position in the input string.\n\nAfter the `for` loop, the function creates an empty string `s` and iterates through each character in the `new_str` list using another `for` loop. For each character, it appends the character to the `s` string.\n\nThe function then checks if the `flg` variable is still 0. If it is, it means that no alphabets were found in the input string. In this case, it returns the reverse of the `s` string using the slicing notation `s[len(s)::-1]`. If `flg` is not 0, it means that at least one alphabet was found in the input string and the function returns the `s` string as is.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string solve(std::string s) {\n"

The function takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe function returns `True` if the square of one side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThe function checks this condition for each of the three sides of the triangle using the `or` operator. If any of the conditions are true, the function returns `True`. If none of the conditions are true, the function returns `False`.\n\nThe function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function (`right_angle_triangle`), and the arguments it takes (`a`, `b`, and `c`). The `-> bool` syntax after the argument list specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that returns the result of the boolean expression that checks whether the triangle is a right angle triangle. The expression is composed of three parts, each of which checks whether one of the sides of the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. The `==` operator is used to compare the square of one side to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The `or` operator is used to combine the three conditions into a single boolean expression. \n\nThe function returns the result of this expression using the `return` keyword. If the expression is true, the function returns `True`. If the expression is false, the function returns `False`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool right_angle_triangle(long a, long b, long c) {\n"

Define a function `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns an integer.\n2. While `b` is not zero, do the following:\n    1. Assign `b` to `a` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` to `b`.\n3. Return `a`.\n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. The `while` loop in the code implements this process. The variables `a` and `b` are updated in each iteration of the loop to be the smaller and larger numbers respectively. The `%` operator is used to calculate the remainder. The `return` statement returns the last non-zero remainder, which is the greatest common divisor.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong greatest_common_divisor(long a, long b) {\n"

The `-> str` after the argument indicates that the function returns a string.\n\nThe function returns a new string that is created by joining together all the characters in the input string that are not vowels. \n\nThe `\"\".join()` method is used to concatenate all the characters that pass the condition. The `join()` method is called on an empty string, which means that the characters will be concatenated with no separator between them.\n\nThe `[]` brackets contain a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the input string. The `if` statement checks if the character is a vowel. If the character is a vowel, it is not included in the output string. \n\nThe `s.lower()` method is used to convert the character to lowercase before checking if it is a vowel. This is done to ensure that both uppercase and lowercase vowels are removed from the string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the new string with all the vowels removed.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string remove_vowels(std::string text) {\n"

The `[-1]` index selects the last word in the list and assigns it to the variable `check`.\n\n3. `return True if len(check) == 1 and (97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False` - This line returns a boolean value based on the following conditions:\n    - `len(check) == 1` checks if the length of the last word is equal to 1.\n    - `(97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122)` checks if the ASCII value of the last character is between 97 and 122, which corresponds to the lowercase letters a to z. The `ord()` function returns the ASCII value of a character, and `check.lower()` converts the character to lowercase before checking its ASCII value.\n    - If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

For each character, if it is an opening bracket (i.e. \"<\"), the depth is incremented by 1. If it is a closing bracket (i.e. \">\"), the depth is decremented by 1. If the depth ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. \n\nAfter iterating through all the characters, if the depth is 0, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns False. \n\nThe function takes in a single argument, `brackets`, which is a string of brackets. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced. \n\nThe function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name (`correct_bracketing`), and the function arguments (`brackets: str`). The `-> bool` after the argument list indicates that the function returns a boolean. \n\nThe `depth` variable is initialized to 0 before the loop. \n\nThe loop iterates through each character in the `brackets` string using a for loop. The loop variable `b` takes on the value of each character in turn. \n\nThe if statement checks whether the current character is an opening bracket (\"<\"). If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1. \n\nThe else statement is executed if the current character is not an opening bracket (i.e. it must be a closing bracket). In this case, the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. \n\nThe second if statement checks whether the `depth` variable is negative. If it is, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. \n\nAfter the loop, the function checks whether the `depth` variable is 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns False. \n\nOverall, the function checks whether a string of brackets is correctly balanced by keeping track of the depth of the brackets (i.e. the number of opening brackets minus the number of closing brackets) and returning False if the depth ever becomes negative.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef intersection(interval1: Tuple[int, int], interval2: Tuple[int, int]) -> str:\n    def is_prime(num):\n        if num == 1 or num == 0:\n            return False\n        if num == 2:\n            return True\n        for i in range(2, num):\n            if num%i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])\n    r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])\n    length = r - l\n    if length > 0 and is_prime(length):\n        return \"YES\"\n    return \"NO\"\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `intersection` that takes two tuples of integers as input and returns a string \"YES\" if the intersection of the two intervals is a prime number, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `Tuple` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the input and output of the `intersection` function.\n\nThe `intersection` function takes two tuples of integers as input, `interval1` and `interval2`, and returns a string.\n\nThe next line defines a nested function called `is_prime` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `num` is a prime number or not. The function checks if `num` is equal to 1 or 0, and returns `False` if it is. If `num` is equal to 2, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and `num-1`, and returns `False` if it is. If `num` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `num-1`, the function returns `True`.\n\nThe next three lines of the code calculate the intersection of the two intervals. The variable `l` is assigned the maximum value between the first element of `interval1` and the first element of `interval2`. The variable `r` is assigned the minimum value between the second element of `interval1` and the second element of `interval2`. The variable `length` is assigned the difference between `r` and `l`.\n\nThe next line checks if the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If the length is greater than 0 and is a prime number, the function returns \"YES\". Otherwise, the function returns \"NO\".<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string intersection(std::tuple<long, long> interval1, std::tuple<long, long> interval2) {\n"

The sorting algorithm used is a strange one, where the first element is the smallest, the second element is the largest, the third element is the second smallest, the fourth element is the second largest, and so on. \n\nThe function starts by importing the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the input and output of the function.\n\nThe function definition starts with `def strange_sort_list(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:`. This defines a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list of integers `lst` as input and returns a list of integers. The `-> List[int]` specifies the type of the output.\n\nThe next line creates two empty lists `res` and `switch`. `res` will be used to store the sorted list and `switch` will be used to keep track of whether the next element to be added to `res` should be the smallest or largest.\n\nThe next line starts a while loop that runs as long as `lst` is not empty. \n\nThe first line inside the while loop appends the smallest or largest element of `lst` to `res` depending on the value of `switch`. If `switch` is `True`, the smallest element is appended, otherwise the largest element is appended. The `min` and `max` functions are used to find the smallest and largest elements respectively.\n\nThe second line inside the while loop removes the last element of `lst` from the list. This is done to ensure that the next smallest or largest element is selected in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nThe third line inside the while loop toggles the value of `switch` by using the `not` operator. This ensures that the next element to be appended to `res` is the opposite of the previous element.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sorted list `res`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> strange_sort_list(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The function signature specifies the input type and the return type.\n3. `count_digit = dict([(i, 0) for i in lst])` - Creating a dictionary called `count_digit` that maps each integer in the input list to the value 0. This dictionary will be used to count the occurrences of each integer in the input list.\n4. `for i in lst:` - Looping through each integer in the input list.\n5. `count_digit[i]+=1` - Incrementing the count of the integer `i` in the `count_digit` dictionary.\n6. `if any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst):` - Checking if any integer in the input list occurs more than twice. If so, return False.\n7. `if all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))):` - Checking if the input list is sorted in non-descending order. This is done by checking if each element in the list is greater than or equal to the previous element. The `all` function returns True if all elements in the iterable are True.\n8. `return True` - If the input list is sorted in non-descending order and contains at most two occurrences of each integer, return True.\n9. `else:` - If the input list is not sorted in non-descending order or contains more than two occurrences of at least one integer, return False.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_sorted(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The function finds the smallest integer that appears at least as many times as its value in the input list. If there is no such integer, the function returns -1.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module.

The function is defined using Python's type hinting syntax, which specifies the type of the input parameter and the return value.\n\nThe third line creates a new list called `frq` that has a length equal to the maximum value in the input list plus one. Each element of the `frq` list is initialized to 0.\n\nThe fourth line starts a loop that iterates over each element in the input list.

For each integer `i`, the code checks if the value of the `i`th element in the `frq` list is greater than or equal to `i`. If it is, the value of `i` is assigned to the `ans` variable.\n\nThe seventh line returns the value of the `ans` variable.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong search(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The function is defined with type annotations for the input and output.\n\n```python\n    if n == 1: return 1\n```\nThis line checks if the input `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1. This is because there is only one integer between 1 and 10^1 (inclusive) that starts with the digit 1, which is 1 itself.\n\n```python\n    return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))\n```\nThis line calculates the number of integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. The formula used is `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`. \n\n- `10 ** (n - 2)` calculates 10 to the power of `n - 2`. This is because if `n` is 2, we want to calculate the number of integers between 1 and 10^2 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. There are 10 integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1, and 10^2 is 100, so we need to multiply by 10 to get the correct number of integers. Similarly, if `n` is 3, we want to calculate the number of integers between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. There are 100 integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1, so we need to multiply by 100 to get the correct number of integers. In general, we need to multiply by 10^(n-2) to get the correct number of integers.\n\n- `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))` calculates the number of integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. This is because there are 9 digits that can follow the digit 1 (0-9), and each of these digits can be followed by any of the remaining `n-1` digits. So there are `9 * (n-1)` integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. However, we need to add the 1 integer that starts with 1 and has `n-1` digits (e.g. if `n` is 3, the integer 100 starts with 1 and has 2 digits). So the total number of integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1 is `9 * (n-1) + 1`, which simplifies to `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) {\n"

The `len` function returns the length of the string.\n\nInside the loop, the function checks if the character at the current index `i` is equal to the character at the opposite end of the string, which is given by `len(text) - 1 - i`.

The `-> List[int]` part of the line specifies that the function returns a list of integers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n```\nThis line imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.\n\n```python\nfact = []\n```\nThis line initializes an empty list called `fact`.\n\n```python\ni = 2\n```\nThis line initializes a variable `i` to 2.\n\n```python\nwhile i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1):\n```\nThis line starts a while loop that will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` plus 1. The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the square root calculation to an integer.\n\n```python\nif n % i == 0:\n```\nThis line checks if `n` is divisible by `i` with no remainder.\n\n```python\nfact.append(i)\nn //= i\n```\nIf `n` is divisible by `i`, the code appends `i` to the `fact` list and divides `n` by `i`. The `//=` operator is used to perform integer division and assignment in one step.\n\n```python\nelse:\n    i += 1\n```\nIf `n` is not divisible by `i`, the code increments `i` by 1 and continues the loop.\n\n```python\nif n > 1:\n    fact.append(n)\n```\nAfter the loop completes, the code checks if `n` is greater than 1. If it is, `n` is a prime number and is appended to the `fact` list.\n\n```python\nreturn fact\n```\nFinally, the function returns the `fact` list containing the prime factors of `n`.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> factorize(long n) {\n"

The `grid` parameter is of type `List[List[int]]` and the return value is of type `List[int]`.\n\n```python\nn = len(grid)\n```\nGetting the length of the `grid` list and storing it in the variable `n`.\n\n```python\nval = n * n + 1\n```\nInitializing the variable `val` to `n * n + 1`. This is the maximum possible value of a cell in the `grid` list.\n\n```python\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if grid[i][j] == 1:\n            temp = []\n            if i != 0:\n                temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n\n            if j != 0:\n                temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n\n            if i != n - 1:\n                temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n\n            if j != n - 1:\n                temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n\n            val = min(temp)\n```\nIterating over each cell in the `grid` list. If the value of the cell is `1`, then the values of the adjacent cells are added to a temporary list `temp`. The minimum value in `temp` is then stored in the variable `val`.\n\n```python\nans = []\nfor i in range(k):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        ans.append(1)\n    else:\n        ans.append(val)\nreturn ans\n```\nInitializing an empty list `ans`. Then, iterating over the range `k`. If the index `i` is even, then `1` is appended to `ans`. Otherwise, the value of `val` is appended to `ans`. Finally, `ans` is returned.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> minPath(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long k) {\n"

The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted string. \n\nThe first line of the function definition specifies the function signature. The function takes a string `s` as input and returns a string. The `->` symbol is used to specify the return type of the function.\n\nThe second line of the function creates a string `d` containing all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n\nThe third line of the function initializes an empty string `out` which will be used to store the encrypted string.\n\nThe fourth line of the function starts a loop that iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`.\n\nThe fifth line of the function checks if the current character `c` is a lowercase letter of the English alphabet. If it is, the next line is executed, otherwise the else block is executed.\n\nThe sixth line of the function finds the index of the current character `c` in the string `d`. It then adds 4 to this index (2*2) and takes the result modulo 26. This gives the index of the encrypted character in the string `d`. The encrypted character is then appended to the `out` string.\n\nThe seventh line of the function is executed if the current character `c` is not a lowercase letter of the English alphabet. In this case, the current character is simply appended to the `out` string.\n\nThe eighth line of the function returns the encrypted string.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encrypt(std::string s) {\n"
