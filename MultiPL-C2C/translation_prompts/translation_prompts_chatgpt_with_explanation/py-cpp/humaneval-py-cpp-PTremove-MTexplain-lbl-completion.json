The function iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop. \n\nFor each character, the function checks if it is an opening bracket (i.e., \"(\"). If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1. If it is a closing bracket (i.e., \")\"), the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. \n\nIf the `depth` variable becomes negative at any point during the iteration, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False` immediately. \n\nAfter the iteration is complete, the function checks if the `depth` variable is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have been closed, so the function returns `True`.

The function returns a tuple of two optional integers, which is specified using the `Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int]]` type hint.\n\nThe first line of the function creates a new list `smallest` that contains all the negative integers in the input list `lst`. This is done using the `filter` function, which takes a lambda function that returns `True` for elements that should be included in the filtered list. In this case, the lambda function checks if the element is less than zero.\n\nThe second line of the function creates a new list `largest` that contains all the positive integers in the input list `lst`.

The `if` statements check if the filtered lists are empty, and return `None` if they are. The `else` clause returns the maximum or minimum value in the filtered list. The tuple is constructed using parentheses, and the two values are separated by a comma.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<std::optional<long>, std::optional<long>> largest_smallest_integers(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The function uses a list called `results` to store the last four numbers in the sequence. The list is initialized with the first four numbers in the sequence: 0, 0, 2, 0. The reason for this initialization is that the first three numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, so we need to skip them to get to the fourth number, which is 2.\n\nIf `n` is less than 4, the function simply returns the corresponding number from the `results` list.\n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the function enters a loop that runs `n - 3` times. In each iteration of the loop, the function appends the sum of the last four numbers in the `results` list to the list, and then removes the first number in the list. This is done to keep the list length at four, so that we always have the last four numbers in the sequence.\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function returns the last number in the `results` list, which is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib4(long n) {\n"

The List type is used to specify that the function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers as output.\n\n```\ndef sort_even(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n```\nThis line defines the function `sort_even` that takes a list of integers `l` as input and returns a list of integers as output. The `-> List[int]` specifies that the output is a list of integers.\n\n```\nevens = l[::2]\nodds = l[1::2]\n```\nThese two lines create two new lists, `evens` and `odds`, by slicing the input list `l`. The `evens` list contains all the even-indexed elements of `l`, while the `odds` list contains all the odd-indexed elements of `l`.\n\n```\nevens.sort()\n```\nThis line sorts the `evens` list in ascending order.\n\n```\nans = []\nfor e, o in zip(evens, odds):\n    ans.extend([e, o])\n```\nThese lines create a new list `ans` that contains the sorted even numbers and the odd numbers in their original position. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the `evens` and `odds` lists in parallel, and the `extend` method is used to add the even and odd numbers to the `ans` list.\n\n```\nif len(evens) > len(odds):\n    ans.append(evens[-1])\n```\nThis line checks if the `evens` list is longer than the `odds` list. If it is, then the last element of the `evens` list (which is the largest even number) is added to the `ans` list.\n\n```\nreturn ans\n```\nThis line returns the `ans` list, which contains the sorted even numbers and the odd numbers in their original position. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_even(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The sorting is done based on the sum of the digits of each integer. The function uses a helper function called `digits_sum` to calculate the sum of the digits of an integer.\n\nThe `order_by_points` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of integers. The sorting is done based on the sum of the digits of each integer. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of integers. The `key` parameter is set to the `digits_sum` function, which is used to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer.\n\nThe `digits_sum` function takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. The function first checks if the integer is negative and sets a flag `neg` accordingly. If the integer is negative, it is converted to a positive integer. The integer is then converted to a list of digits using the `str` and `int` functions. The first digit in the list is multiplied by the `neg` flag to restore the original sign of the integer. The sum of the digits is then calculated using the `sum` function and returned.\n\nHere is the equivalent C++ code:\n\n```cpp\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> order_by_points(std::vector<long> nums) {\n"

The resulting list of ceil() values is then summed using the sum() function, and the final result is returned.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the cmath library for the ceil() function, and use a vector of vectors to represent the grid parameter.

The function takes two arguments: a list of floating point numbers and a float threshold. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any elements in the list that are closer than the threshold.\n\nThe function starts by defining a function called `has_close_elements` that takes two arguments: `numbers` and `threshold`. The `numbers` argument is a list of floating point numbers, and the `threshold` argument is a float that represents the maximum distance between two elements in the list.\n\nThe function then uses a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the `numbers` list. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. The loop assigns the index to the variable `idx` and the value to the variable `elem`.\n\nInside the first loop, there is another `for` loop that iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. This loop also uses the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. The loop assigns the index to the variable `idx2` and the value to the variable `elem2`.\n\nThe `if` statement inside the second loop checks if the index of the current element (`idx`) is not equal to the index of the other element (`idx2`). If the indices are not equal, then the distance between the two elements is calculated using the `abs` function and assigned to the variable `distance`.\n\nIf the distance between the two elements is less than the threshold, then the function returns `True`. This means that there are two elements in the list that are closer than the threshold.\n\nIf the function has not returned `True` by the end of the loops, then it returns `False`. This means that there are no elements in the list that are closer than the threshold.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n"

The function is called `numerical_letter_grade` and it takes in a list of floats called `grades` and returns a list of strings.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `grades` parameter.\n\nThe second line defines the function `numerical_letter_grade` which takes in a list of floats called `grades` and returns a list of strings.\n\nThe third line initializes an empty list called `letter_grade`.\n\nThe fourth line starts a for loop that iterates over each element in the `grades` list. The loop variable is called `gpa`.\n\nThe next few lines use if-elif statements to determine the letter grade for each numerical grade. If the numerical grade is equal to 4.0, the letter grade is \"A+\". If the numerical grade is greater than 3.7, the letter grade is \"A\". If the numerical grade is greater than 3.3, the letter grade is \"A-\". And so on.\n\nThe last line of the loop appends the letter grade to the `letter_grade` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `letter_grade` list.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> numerical_letter_grade(std::vector<float> grades) {\n"

The function returns `y` if `n` is divisible by any integer other than 1 and `n` itself, otherwise it returns `x`.\n\n```python\ndef x_or_y(n: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n```\n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `x_or_y`, and the parameter list in parentheses. The parameter list consists of three parameters, `n`, `x`, and `y`, all of which are integers. The `-> int` annotation indicates that the function returns an integer.\n\n```python\n    if n == 1:\n        return y\n```\n\nThe first line of the function body checks if `n` is equal to 1.

For each integer `i` in the range, the loop checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function returns `y` and exits the loop using the `break` statement. If the loop completes without finding a divisor of `n`, the function returns `x`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong x_or_y(long n, long x, long y) {\n"

This variable will be used to keep track of how many integers in the input list meet the criteria specified in the function.\n\nThe function then iterates over each integer in the input list using a `for` loop. For each integer, the function checks if it is greater than 10. If it is not, the function moves on to the next integer in the list.\n\nIf the integer is greater than 10, the function creates a tuple called `odd_digits` that contains the odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). The function then converts the integer to a string using Python's built-in `str` function and assigns the resulting string to a variable called `number_as_string`.\n\nThe function then checks if the first and last digits of the string representation of the integer are odd digits. It does this by converting the first and last characters of the string to integers using Python's built-in `int` function and checking if they are in the `odd_digits` tuple. If both the first and last digits are odd, the function increments the `count` variable by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the number of integers in the input list that meet the criteria specified in the function.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong specialFilter(std::vector<long> nums) {\n"

If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an empty tuple.\n\nIf both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names and are not the same planet, the function finds the index of each planet in the `planet_names` tuple using the `index` method. \n\nIf `planet1` comes before `planet2` in the `planet_names` tuple, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple from the index of `planet1` plus one to the index of `planet2`. This slice includes all the planets between `planet1` and `planet2` in the solar system.\n\nIf `planet2` comes before `planet1` in the `planet_names` tuple, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple from the index of `planet2` plus one to the index of `planet1`. This slice includes all the planets between `planet2` and `planet1` in the solar system.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> bf(std::string planet1, std::string planet2) {\n"

Can you explain what this Python program does line by line? The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n    ns = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:\n            ns.append(i)\n    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))\n    ans = 0\n    for c in s:\n        ans += (c == '7')\n    return ans\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of the FizzBuzz problem. The problem is to print the numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\".\n\nThe function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. \n\nThe function first initializes an empty list `ns`. \n\nThen, the function loops through all the integers from 0 to n-1 using the `range` function. If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, it is appended to the list `ns`.\n\nThe list `ns` is then converted to a string `s` using the `join` method. The `join` method concatenates all the elements of the list into a single string. The `map` function is used to convert each integer in the list to a string.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable `ans` to 0. The function loops through each character in the string `s`. If the character is '7', the variable `ans` is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`.\n\nThe program counts the number of integers from 0 to n-1 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7'. The program does not print anything to the console. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the Python-specific syntax with C++ equivalents. For example, you would need to replace the `range` function with a `for` loop that iterates over the integers from 0 to n-1. You would also need to replace the `map` function with a loop that converts each integer in the list to a string. Additionally, you would need to replace the `join` method with a loop that concatenates the elements of the list into a single string. The `if` statement and the `+=` operator can be used directly in C++. The `return` statement can also be used directly in C++. \n\nHere is an example of how the program could be rewritten in C++:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fizz_buzz(long n) {\n"

The function returns a string that represents the name of the extension that has the strongest name.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable called `strong` to the first element of the `extensions` list. This variable will be used to keep track of the extension with the strongest name. The next line initializes a variable called `my_val` to the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in the first extension in the `extensions` list.\n\nThe next block of code is a loop that iterates over each element in the `extensions` list. For each element, it calculates the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in the string and stores it in a variable called `val`. If `val` is greater than `my_val`, then it updates `strong` to be the current element and `my_val` to be `val`.\n\nFinally, the function constructs a string called `ans` that concatenates `class_name`, a period, and the value of `strong`.

The function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `largest_divisor`. The function takes one argument, `n`, which is of type `int`. The return type of the function is also `int`, which is specified using the `->` syntax.\n\nThe function uses a `for` loop to iterate over all integers in the range `n-1` to `0`, in reverse order. The `reversed` function is used to reverse the order of the range. This is done to ensure that the largest divisor is returned first.\n\nWithin the loop, the `if` statement checks if `n` is divisible by the current integer `i`. If it is, then `i` is returned as the largest divisor of `n`. If no divisor is found, the function returns `None`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong largest_divisor(long n) {\n"

The function takes a single argument called `numbers` which is of type `str` and returns a string of type `str`.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module.

The keys of the dictionary are English words and the values are integers. This dictionary is used later in the function to convert English words to integers.\n\nThe fourth line of the code splits the input string `numbers` into a list of space-separated strings using the `split` method. The resulting list is filtered using a list comprehension to remove any empty strings. The resulting list contains only the English words representing the numbers to be sorted.\n\nThe fifth line of the code sorts the list of English words using the `sorted` function. The `key` argument is used to specify a function that maps each English word to its corresponding integer value using the `value_map` dictionary.\n\nThe sixth line of the code joins the sorted list of English words into a space-separated string using the `join` method and returns the resulting string.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string sort_numbers(std::string numbers) {\n"

The function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `x` argument and the return value of the function.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThe second line of the code defines the `unique_digits` function. The function takes a single argument `x` which is a list of integers. The function returns a list of integers.\n\n```python\ndef unique_digits(x: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n```\n\nThe third line of the code initializes an empty list called `odd_digit_elements`. This list will be used to store the integers that have only odd digits.\n\n```python\n    odd_digit_elements = []\n```\n\nThe fourth line of the code starts a `for` loop that iterates over each element in the `x` list.\n\n```python\n    for i in x:\n```\n\nThe fifth line of the code checks if all the digits in the current integer are odd. This is done by converting the integer to a string and then checking if each character in the string is odd. If all the digits are odd, the integer is added to the `odd_digit_elements` list.\n\n```python\n        if all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i)):\n            odd_digit_elements.append(i)\n```\n\nThe sixth line of the code returns the `odd_digit_elements` list sorted in ascending order.\n\n```python\n    return sorted(odd_digit_elements)\n```\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> unique_digits(std::vector<long> x) {\n"

It does this by iterating over all integers from 2 to the square root of the input integer, checking if any of them divide the input integer evenly. If any of them do, the function returns False, indicating that the input integer is not prime. If none of them do, the function returns True, indicating that the input integer is prime.\n\nThe function then initializes two variables: `maxx` and `i`. `maxx` is initialized to 0, and will be used to keep track of the largest prime number found in the list. `i` is initialized to 0, and will be used to iterate over the list.\n\nThe function then enters a while loop that will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element of the list (`lst[i]`) is greater than `maxx` and is prime (as determined by the `isPrime` function). If it is, then `maxx` is set to `lst[i]`. The loop then increments `i` by 1.\n\nAfter the loop completes, the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` by converting it to a string, iterating over each character in the string, converting it back to an integer, and summing them all together. The result is then returned.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong skjkasdkd(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each character in `vowels` and creates a tuple with the original character and the character two positions to the right in the ASCII table. The `dict()` function is then called with this list of tuples as an argument, which creates a dictionary with the tuples as key-value pairs.\n\nThe third line of the function calls the `swapcase()` method on the `message` string.

The `sum` function takes a boolean expression that checks if each character in `s` is a vowel, and returns the sum of all the `True` values. \n\nThe function then checks if the last character of the input string `s` is either 'y' or 'Y'. If it is, then the function increments the `n_vowels` variable by 1. This is because the letter 'y' can sometimes be considered a vowel, depending on its position in a word. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `n_vowels` variable, which represents the total number of vowels in the input string `s`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong vowels_count(std::string s) {\n"

The function takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings as output. The input list is sorted in ascending order and then a new list is created. The new list contains only the strings from the input list that have an even number of characters. The new list is then sorted in ascending order based on the length of the strings. Finally, the sorted new list is returned as output.\n\nHere is a line-by-line explanation:\n\n1. `from typing import List`: This line imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the input and output parameters of the function.\n\n2. `def sorted_list_sum(lst: List[str]) -> List[str]:` This line defines the function `sorted_list_sum`. The function takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings as output. The `->` symbol is used to specify the return type of the function.\n\n3. `lst.sort()`: This line sorts the input list in ascending order.\n\n4. `new_lst = []`: This line creates an empty list called `new_lst`.\n\n5. `for i in lst:`: This line starts a loop that iterates over each element in the input list.\n\n6. `if len(i)%2 == 0:`: This line checks if the length of the current string is even.\n\n7. `new_lst.append(i)`: This line adds the current string to the `new_lst` list if its length is even.\n\n8. `return sorted(new_lst, key=len)`: This line returns a sorted list of strings based on the length of the strings. The `sorted` function is used to sort the `new_lst` list in ascending order based on the length of the strings. The `key` parameter is used to specify the sorting criteria. In this case, the `len` function is used as the sorting criteria.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> sorted_list_sum(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

In this case, we are importing the `Dict` type hint, which is used to indicate that the input is a dictionary with string keys and string values.\n\n```python\ndef check_dict_case(dict: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:\n```\nThis line defines the function `check_dict_case` that takes a dictionary with string keys and string values as input and returns a boolean value.\n\n```python\nif len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n    return False\n```\nIf the dictionary is empty, the function returns `False`.\n\n```python\nelse:\n    state = \"start\"\n    for key in dict.keys():\n```\nOtherwise, the function initializes a variable `state` to `\"start\"` and iterates over the keys of the dictionary.\n\n```python\nif isinstance(key, str) == False:\n    state = \"mixed\"\n    break\n```\nFor each key, the function checks if it is a string. If it is not, the function sets `state` to `\"mixed\"` and breaks out of the loop.\n\n```python\nif state == \"start\":\n    if key.isupper():\n        state = \"upper\"\n    elif key.islower():\n        state = \"lower\"\n    else:\n        break\n```\nIf `state` is `\"start\"`, the function checks if the key is all uppercase or all lowercase. If it is all uppercase, the function sets `state` to `\"upper\"`. If it is all lowercase, the function sets `state` to `\"lower\"`. If the key is neither all uppercase nor all lowercase, the function breaks out of the loop.\n\n```python\nelif (state == \"upper\" and not key.isupper()) or (state == \"lower\" and not key.islower()):\n        state = \"mixed\"\n        break\n```\nIf `state` is `\"upper\"` or `\"lower\"`, the function checks if the current key is in the same case as the previous keys. If it is not, the function sets `state` to `\"mixed\"` and breaks out of the loop.\n\n```python\nelse:\n    continue\n```\nIf the key is in the same case as the previous keys, the function continues to the next key.\n\n```python\nreturn state == \"upper\" or state == \"lower\"\n```\nAfter iterating over all the keys, the function returns `True` if `state` is `\"upper\"` or `\"lower\"`, and `False` otherwise.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool check_dict_case(std::map<std::string,std::string> dict) {\n"

The sequence starts with 1 and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous numbers and the next natural number. For example, the first six numbers of the sequence are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is zero. If it is, it returns a list containing only the number 1. Otherwise, it initializes a list `my_tri` with the first two numbers of the sequence, 1 and 3.\n\nThen, it loops through the range from 2 to `n + 1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is even. If it is, it calculates the next number in the sequence by adding `i / 2 + 1` to the list `my_tri`. If `i` is odd, it calculates the next number by adding the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence and `(i + 3) / 2` to the list `my_tri`.\n\nFinally, it returns the list `my_tri` containing the first `n` numbers of the Triangular number sequence. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the `List` type with a C++ vector and adjust the syntax accordingly. Here is an example implementation in C++:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> tri(long n) {\n"

The -> float specifies the return type of the function.\n\nThe third line sorts the input list in ascending order using the sorted() function. The sorted() function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original list.\n\nThe fourth line checks if the length of the sorted list is odd or even. If it is odd, the function returns the middle element of the list using integer division (//) to get the index of the middle element. If it is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements.\n\nThe function can be rewritten in C++ as follows:\n\n```cpp\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat median(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The `sorted` function is used to sort the input list in ascending order.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this implementation, the sequence starts with 0, 0, 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the previous three numbers.\n\nThe function `fibfib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. The function first checks if `n` is 0, 1, or 2. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 0. If `n` is 2, the function returns 1. If `n` is greater than 2, the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3` as inputs, and returns the sum of those three recursive calls.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you could use the following code:\n\n```c++\nint fibfib(int n) {\n    if (n == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (n == 1) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (n == 2) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the C++ version is very similar to the Python version, but with some minor syntax differences. In C++, the function does not have a return type annotation, and the function name and parameter type are specified differently. Additionally, the `if` statements are enclosed in curly braces, and the `return` statements end with a semicolon. However, the logic of the program is the same in both languages.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fibfib(long n) {\n"

This means that the function returns the decimal part of the input number.\n\nFor example, if the input number is 3.14159, the function will return 0.14159. If the input number is 2.0, the function will return 0.0. \n\nThe function can be rewritten in C++ as follows:\n\n```cpp\nfloat truncate_number(float number) {\n    return fmod(number, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nThe `fmod` function is used to calculate the remainder of the input number divided by 1.0. It is included in the `<cmath>` library. \n\nNote that the C++ version of the function does not have type annotations as C++ does not support them. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat truncate_number(float number) {\n"

The function first checks if p is less than 2, in which case it returns False. Otherwise, it loops through all integers k from 2 up to the minimum of the square root of p plus 1 and p minus 1. For each k, it checks if p is divisible by k. If it is, then p is not prime and the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding a divisor for p, then p is prime and the function returns True.\n\nThe function then initializes a list f with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n\nThe function then enters a loop that repeatedly appends the sum of the last two elements of f to f. This generates the Fibonacci sequence. For each new element added to f, the function checks if it is prime by calling the is_prime function. If it is, then n is decremented by 1. If n reaches 0, then the function returns the last element of f, which is the nth prime Fibonacci number.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong prime_fib(long n) {\n"

The `-> List[int]` specifies that the function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe first line of the function checks if the `need` is less than or equal to the `remaining`. If it is, then the function returns a list containing two integers. The first integer is the sum of `number` and `need`, and the second integer is the difference between `remaining` and `need`. \n\nIf `need` is greater than `remaining`, the function returns a list containing two integers. The first integer is the sum of `number` and `remaining`, and the second integer is 0.\n\nThe function is written in Python and can be easily rewritten in C++ by replacing the `def` keyword with the function signature, removing the `-> List[int]` type hint, and replacing the `:` with `{`. The `return` statement can be replaced with `return { number + need , remaining-need }` for the first case and `return { number + remaining , 0 }` for the second case. \n\nHere is the C++ equivalent:\n\n```cpp\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n"

The function is defined using Python's type hints to indicate that the input is a list of strings and the output is a list of strings.\n\nThe function starts by creating an empty list called `res` that will be used to store the output strings. It then loops over each string in the input list using a `for` loop. The loop variable `arr` is used to refer to the current string being processed.\n\nThe next line of code calculates the number of odd digits in the current string. This is done using a generator expression that iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is odd. If the character is odd, the expression returns `True`, which is then converted to an integer value of `1`. If the character is even, the expression returns `False`, which is converted to an integer value of `0`. The `sum` function is then used to add up all the `1` values, which gives the total number of odd digits in the string.\n\nThe next line of code creates a new string that describes the result of the calculation. The string is constructed using string concatenation and the `str` function to convert the integer values to strings. The resulting string is then appended to the `res` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` list containing all the output strings.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> odd_count(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

The tuples are sorted first by row, then by column.\n\nThe function is defined with the following signature:\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst: List[List[int]], x: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n```\n\nThe input is a list of lists of integers `lst` and an integer `x`. The output is a list of tuples of integers.\n\nThe first line of the function creates a list of all coordinates `(i, j)` in the input list of lists where the value is equal to `x`. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over all rows `i` and columns `j` of the input list of lists, and selects the coordinates where the value is equal to `x`. The resulting list of coordinates is assigned to the variable `coords`.\n\n```python\ncoords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]\n```\n\nThe second line of the function sorts the list of coordinates first by column, then by row. This is done using the `sorted` function with two key functions. The first key function sorts the coordinates by column in descending order, so that the coordinates with the highest column value come first. The second key function sorts the coordinates by row in ascending order, so that the coordinates with the lowest row value come first.\n\n```python\nreturn sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])\n```\n\nThe `sorted` function takes two arguments: the list of coordinates `coords`, and a key function that specifies how to sort the list. The first `sorted` function sorts the list of coordinates by column in descending order, using a lambda function that returns the second element of each tuple (i.e., the column value). The `reverse=True` argument specifies that the list should be sorted in descending order. The second `sorted` function sorts the resulting list of coordinates by row in ascending order, using a lambda function that returns the first element of each tuple (i.e., the row value).\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::tuple<long, long>> get_row(std::vector<std::vector<long>> lst, long x) {\n"

The function replaces spaces in the input string with underscores and hyphens, depending on the number of spaces in a row.\n\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text: str) -> str:\n```\n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `fix_spaces`. The function takes a single argument `text` of type `str` and returns a value of type `str`. The `->` symbol is used to indicate the return type.\n\n```python\nnew_text = \"\"\ni = 0\nstart, end = 0, 0\n```\n\nThe function initializes three variables: `new_text`, `i`, `start`, and `end`. `new_text` is an empty string that will be used to store the modified text. `i` is an integer variable that will be used to iterate over the input string. `start` and `end` are integer variables that will be used to keep track of the start and end indices of a sequence of spaces.\n\n```python\nwhile i < len(text):\n```\n\nThe function enters a `while` loop that will iterate over the input string until the end is reached.\n\n```python\nif text[i] == \" \":\n    end += 1\n```\n\nIf the current character is a space, the `end` variable is incremented.\n\n```python\nelse:\n    if end - start > 2:\n        new_text += \"-\"+text[i]\n    elif end - start > 0:\n        new_text += \"_\"*(end - start)+text[i]\n    else:\n        new_text += text[i]\n    start, end = i+1, i+1\n```\n\nIf the current character is not a space, the function checks if there was a sequence of spaces before it. If there was, the function replaces the sequence of spaces with a hyphen if the sequence was longer than 2, or with underscores if the sequence was between 1 and 2 characters long. If there was no sequence of spaces, the function simply adds the current character to the `new_text` variable. The `start` and `end` variables are then reset to the current index.\n\n```python\ni+=1\n```\n\nThe `i` variable is incremented to move to the next character in the input string.\n\n```python\nif end - start > 2:\n    new_text += \"-\"\nelif end - start > 0:\n    new_text += \"_\"\n```\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function checks if there was a sequence of spaces at the end of the input string. If there was, the function replaces the sequence of spaces with a hyphen if the sequence was longer than 2, or with an underscore if the sequence was between 1 and 2 characters long.\n\n```python\nreturn new_text\n```\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified text.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string fix_spaces(std::string text) {\n"

Given a list of integers, the algorithm returns a list of integers where each element is the maximum value of the original list up to that point.\n\nThe function `rolling_max` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers. The function uses the `List` and `Tuple` types from the `typing` module.\n\nThe function initializes two variables: `running_max` and `result`. `running_max` is set to `None` and `result` is set to an empty list.\n\nThe function then iterates over the input list using a `for` loop. For each element `n` in the input list, the function checks if `running_max` is `None`. If it is, `running_max` is set to `n`. If it is not, `running_max` is set to the maximum value between `running_max` and `n`.\n\nThe maximum value is calculated using the built-in `max` function. The `max` function takes two arguments and returns the larger of the two.\n\nAfter `running_max` is updated, the current value of `running_max` is appended to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> rolling_max(std::vector<long> numbers) {\n"

The function returns the result of the algebraic expression formed by the two lists.\n\nThe `operator` list contains the operators to be used in the expression, while the `operand` list contains the operands. The first element of the `operand` list is the first operand, while the rest of the elements are the remaining operands.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `expression` to the string representation of the first operand. This is done using the `str()` function to convert the integer to a string.\n\nThe function then loops through the `operator` and `operand` lists using the `zip()` function. The `zip()` function returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables passed to it. In this case, it aggregates the elements of `operator` and `operand[1:]`. The `operand[1:]` slice is used to exclude the first element of the `operand` list, which has already been added to the `expression` variable.\n\nInside the loop, the `expression` variable is updated by concatenating the current operator and operand to it. This is done using the `+=` operator, which is a shorthand for `expression = expression + oprt + str(oprn)`.\n\nFinally, the `eval()` function is used to evaluate the algebraic expression stored in the `expression` variable. The `eval()` function takes a string as input and evaluates it as a Python expression. In this case, the string represents a valid Python expression, so `eval()` returns the result of the expression.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong do_algebra(std::vector<std::string> op, std::vector<long> operand) {\n"

The function is called `compare` and takes two arguments, `game` and `guess`. The function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `game` and `guess` arguments. The `List` type is a generic type that specifies a list of elements of a certain type. In this case, the type of the elements is `int`.\n\nThe second line of the code defines the `compare` function. The function takes two arguments, `game` and `guess`, both of which are lists of integers. The function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe third line of the code uses a list comprehension to create a new list. The list comprehension iterates over the `game` and `guess` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function. The `zip` function returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables passed to it. In this case, it aggregates the elements from the `game` and `guess` lists.\n\nThe fourth line of the code uses a lambda function to calculate the absolute difference between the elements from the `game` and `guess` lists. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference.\n\nThe fifth line of the code returns the new list created by the list comprehension.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> compare(std::vector<long> game, std::vector<long> guess) {\n"

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    import collections\n    c = collections.Counter(numbers)\n    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers with all duplicates removed. \n\nThe function is defined with the `def` keyword and takes a single argument called `numbers` which is a list of integers. The `-> List[int]` syntax after the argument definition specifies that the function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe `import collections` statement imports the `collections` module which provides a `Counter` class that can be used to count the number of occurrences of each element in a list.\n\nThe next line creates a new `Counter` object called `c` by passing the `numbers` list to the `Counter` constructor. The `Counter` object is a dictionary-like object that stores the count of each element in the list.\n\nThe final line of the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list called `result` that contains only the elements of the input list `numbers` that have a count of 1 or less in the `Counter` object `c`. The `if c[n] <= 1` condition checks if the count of the current element `n` is less than or equal to 1, and only adds it to the `result` list if it is.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to use the `std::vector` container to represent the list of integers, and the `std::unordered_map` container to represent the `Counter` object. The `std::unordered_map` container provides a similar interface to the `Counter` object in Python, allowing you to count the number of occurrences of each element in the list. The final line of the function would need to be rewritten using a loop to iterate over the elements of the input vector and add them to a new vector if their count is less than or equal to 1 in the `std::unordered_map` object.

The `List[int]` type hint indicates that the function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe function defines a nested function `parse_paren_group` which takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer. This function calculates the maximum depth of a nested parentheses group in the input string.\n\nThe `depth` variable is initialized to 0 and the `max_depth` variable is initialized to 0. The function iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`. If the character is an opening parenthesis, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1 and the `max_depth` variable is updated to the maximum of the current `depth` and `max_depth`. If the character is a closing parenthesis, the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. The function returns the `max_depth` variable.\n\nThe `parse_nested_parens` function returns a list comprehension that applies the `parse_paren_group` function to each substring in the input string `paren_string` that is separated by a space character.

The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each character in the string in turn.\n\nAn `if` statement is used to check if the integer value of the current character is even or odd.

If the remainder is 0, then the integer is even, so the `even_count` variable is incremented. Otherwise, the integer is odd, so the `odd_count` variable is incremented.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of the `even_count` and `odd_count` variables. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_count(long num) {\n"

The function is called `find_max` and takes a single argument `words` which is a list of strings. The function returns a string.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module.

The function takes a single argument `words` which is a list of strings. The function returns a string. The function is defined using the `def` keyword.\n\nThe third line of the code returns the first element of a sorted list of `words`. The list is sorted using a key function that is defined using a lambda expression. The lambda expression takes a single argument `x` and returns a tuple of two values. The first value is the negative length of the set of unique characters in `x`. The second value is `x` itself. The negative length is used to sort the list in descending order of unique characters. The `x` value is used as a tiebreaker to ensure that the first element of the sorted list is returned.\n\nThe `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the string `x`. The `len` function is used to get the length of the resulting set.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string find_max(std::vector<std::string> words) {\n"

The function is implemented in Python.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the input and output of the function.\n\nThe second line defines the function `sort_third`. The function takes a list of integers `l` as input and returns a new list of integers. The `-> List[int]` part specifies that the function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe third line creates a copy of the input list `l` using the `list()` constructor. This is done to avoid modifying the original list.\n\nThe fourth line sorts every third element of the list `l`. This is done using Python's slicing syntax `l[::3]` which selects every third element of the list. The `sorted()` function is then called on this slice to sort the selected elements in ascending order. The sorted elements are then assigned back to the original list using the same slicing syntax `l[::3] = ...`.\n\nThe fifth line returns the sorted list.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_third(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The function is called `solve` and it has two arguments: `s` which is a string and `-> str` which is a type hint that specifies that the function returns a string.\n\nThe first line of the function initializes two variables: `flg` and `idx` to zero. `flg` is a flag variable that is used to check if the input string `s` contains any alphabets. `idx` is an index variable that is used to keep track of the position of the current character in the string.\n\nThe second line of the function creates a new list called `new_str` that contains all the characters of the input string `s`. This is done so that we can modify the characters of the string without affecting the original string.\n\nThe third line of the function starts a for loop that iterates through each character `i` in the input string `s`. \n\nThe fourth line of the function checks if the current character `i` is an alphabet using the `isalpha()` method. If the character is an alphabet, the `swapcase()` method is used to swap the case of the character. The `swapcase()` method returns the character with its case swapped. For example, if the character is 'a', the method returns 'A', and if the character is 'B', the method returns 'b'. The swapped character is then assigned to the corresponding position in the `new_str` list.\n\nThe fifth line of the function sets the `flg` variable to 1 if any alphabet is found in the input string.\n\nThe sixth line of the function increments the `idx` variable by 1 to move to the next position in the string.\n\nThe seventh line of the function creates an empty string called `s`.\n\nThe eighth line of the function starts a for loop that iterates through each character `i` in the `new_str` list.\n\nThe ninth line of the function appends each character `i` to the `s` string.\n\nThe tenth line of the function checks if the `flg` variable is still zero. If it is, it means that no alphabets were found in the input string. In this case, the function returns the reversed string `s`. The `len(s)::-1` syntax is used to reverse the string.\n\nThe eleventh line of the function returns the modified string `s` if any alphabets were found in the input string.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string solve(std::string s) {\n"

If `m` is less than `n`, the function returns `-1`.\n\nThe function `rounded_avg` takes two arguments, `n` and `m`, both integers, and returns a value that is either a string or an integer. The `Union` type hint is used to indicate that the function can return either type.\n\nThe first line of the function checks if `m` is less than `n`. If it is, the function returns `-1`. This is done to ensure that the range of integers between `n` and `m` is not empty.\n\nThe next line initializes a variable `summation` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of all integers between `n` and `m`.\n\nThe `for` loop iterates over all integers between `n` and `m` inclusive, and adds each integer to `summation`. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of integers between `n` and `m+1`, since the `range` function is exclusive of the upper bound.\n\nFinally, the function returns the binary representation of the rounded average of all integers between `n` and `m`. The `round` function is used to round the average to the nearest integer, and the `bin` function is used to convert the result to binary format. The expression `(m - n + 1)` is used to calculate the number of integers between `n` and `m`, which is used as the denominator in the average calculation. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nunion Union_std_string_long{\n    std::string f0;\n    long f1;    Union_std_string_long(std::string _f0) : f0(_f0) {}\n    Union_std_string_long(long _f1) : f1(_f1) {}\n    ~Union_std_string_long() {}\n    bool operator==(std::string f) {\n        return f0 == f ;\n    }    bool operator==(long f) {\n        return f1 == f ;\n    }\n};\nUnion_std_string_long rounded_avg(long n, long m) {\n"

The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`.\n\nAfter the loop completes, the value of `a` is returned, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong greatest_common_divisor(long a, long b) {\n"

If it is, then the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is monotonic. If the list is not sorted in either of these ways, then the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not monotonic. \n\nThe `sorted` function is used to sort the list in ascending or descending order, depending on the arguments passed to it. If no arguments are passed, then the list is sorted in ascending order by default. If the `reverse` argument is set to `True`, then the list is sorted in descending order. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to create a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vector is monotonic or not. You would also need to implement the sorting logic to check if the vector is sorted in either ascending or descending order.

The function is named `iscube`.\n\nThe first line of the function `a = abs(a)` takes the absolute value of the input integer `a`. This is done to ensure that the function works correctly for negative integers as well.\n\nThe second line of the function `return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a` is where the actual check for perfect cube is done. \n\nThe expression `a ** (1. / 3)` calculates the cube root of `a`. The `round` function is used to round off the result to the nearest integer. The `int` function is then used to convert the rounded result to an integer.\n\nThe expression `int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3` calculates the cube of the rounded cube root of `a`.\n\nFinally, the expression `int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a` checks if the cube of the rounded cube root of `a` is equal to `a`. If it is, then the function returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a perfect cube. Otherwise, the function returns `False`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool iscube(long a) {\n"

The function takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the brackets are balanced or not.\n\nThe function works by iterating through the string of brackets one character at a time.

If the depth ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, and the function returns False.

The function calculates the number of prime characters in the input string. A prime character is defined as a character that is either a 2, 3, 5, 7, B or D. \n\nThe function starts by defining a tuple of prime characters called `primes`. It then initializes a variable called `total` to 0. \n\nThe function then loops through each character in the input string using a `for` loop. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to the length of the input string. The `len` function is used to get the length of the input string.\n\nFor each character in the input string, the function checks if the character is a prime character by using the `in` operator to check if the character is in the `primes` tuple. If the character is a prime character, the `total` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `total` variable, which represents the number of prime characters in the input string.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong hex_key(std::string num) {\n"

The regular expression `[.?!]\\s*` is used to split the string at any occurrence of a period, exclamation mark or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters. This ensures that the sentences are split correctly even if there are multiple spaces or other whitespace characters between the punctuation marks.\n\nThe resulting list of sentences is stored in a variable called `sentences`.\n\nThe last line of code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sentence in the `sentences` list and check if the first two characters of the sentence are \"I \". If the condition is true, the expression returns `True` which is equivalent to `1` in Python.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef search(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)\n    for i in lst:\n        frq[i] += 1;\n\n    ans = -1\n    for i in range(1, len(frq)):\n        if frq[i] >= i:\n            ans = i\n    \n    return ans\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `search` that takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer. The function is defined with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `search`, and a parameter `lst` of type `List[int]`. The `-> int` specifies that the function returns an integer.\n\nThe first line inside the function creates a list called `frq` with a length of `max(lst) + 1`. The `max` function returns the largest item in the list, and adding 1 ensures that the list has enough space to store the frequency of each integer in the input list. The `frq` list is initialized with 0s using the `*` operator.\n\nThe next line is a `for` loop that iterates over each integer `i` in the input list `lst`. For each integer, the frequency count in the `frq` list is incremented by 1.\n\nThe next line initializes a variable `ans` to -1. This variable will be used to store the answer to the problem.\n\nThe next `for` loop iterates over the range of integers from 1 to the length of the `frq` list. For each integer `i`, the frequency count in the `frq` list is checked. If the frequency count is greater than or equal to `i`, then `i` is a candidate for the answer. The `ans` variable is updated to `i` if it is a candidate.\n\nFinally, the `ans` variable is returned as the answer to the problem.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong search(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

This is done to ensure that all possible factors of `n` are checked.\n\n```python\n    while i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1):\n```\n\nThe next line checks if `n` is divisible by `i`.

If `k` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function checks if `k` is divisible by any number between 2 and `k-1`. If `k` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number and the function returns `False`. If `k` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number and the function returns `True`. \n\nThe `largest_prime_factor(n)` function then initializes a variable `largest` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the largest prime factor found so far. \n\nThe function then loops through all numbers between 2 and `n+1` (inclusive) using the `range()` function. For each number `j` in this range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `j` and if `j` is a prime number using the `is_prime(j)` function. If both conditions are true, `j` is a prime factor of `n` and the function updates the `largest` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `j`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is the largest prime factor of `n`. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the function definition and type annotations with the appropriate syntax for C++. You would also need to replace the `range()` function with a `for` loop that iterates over the desired range of values. Additionally, you would need to replace the `max()` function with an appropriate method for finding the maximum value.

If the sum is divisible by 3, the triple is added to the list `ans`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the length of the list `ans`, which is the number of triples that satisfy the condition.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong get_max_triples(long n) {\n"

The function takes each word in the input string, sorts the characters in the word and then joins the sorted characters back together to form a new word. The new words are then joined together with a space character to form the output string.\n\nHere is a line by line explanation of the code:\n\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:\n```\nThis line defines the function `anti_shuffle` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a string as output.\n\n```python\nreturn ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])\n```\nThis line is the implementation of the function. It takes the input string `s` and splits it into a list of words using the `split` method. The `split` method splits the string at every space character by default.\n\nFor each word in the list of words, the code sorts the characters in the word using the `sorted` method. The `sorted` method returns a sorted list of characters. The sorted list is then joined back together using the `join` method to form a new word.\n\nThe new words are then collected into a list using a list comprehension. The list comprehension is a shorthand way of creating a list in Python. It is equivalent to using a for loop to iterate over the list of words and appending the new words to a new list.\n\nFinally, the list of new words is joined together using the `join` method with a space character as the separator. The resulting string is then returned as the output of the function.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string anti_shuffle(std::string s) {\n"

The function returns a list of integers.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `grid` argument.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThe next line defines the `minPath` function. It takes two arguments: `grid` and `k`. `grid` is a 2D list of integers and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list of integers.\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:\n```\n\nThe next line gets the length of the `grid` list and assigns it to the variable `n`.\n\n```python\n    n = len(grid)\n```\n\nThe next line initializes the variable `val` to `n * n + 1`. This is an arbitrary large value that will be used to store the minimum value of the neighboring cells.\n\n```python\n    val = n * n + 1\n```\n\nThe next two lines define a nested loop that iterates over each cell in the `grid` list.\n\n```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n```\n\nThe next line checks if the current cell is equal to `1`. If it is, it means that this is the starting cell and we need to find the minimum value of its neighboring cells.\n\n```python\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n```\n\nThe next line initializes an empty list called `temp`. This list will be used to store the values of the neighboring cells.\n\n```python\n                temp = []\n```\n\nThe next four lines check if the current cell has any neighboring cells. If it does, it appends the value of the neighboring cell to the `temp` list.\n\n```python\n                if i != 0:\n                    temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n\n                if j != 0:\n                    temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n\n                if i != n - 1:\n                    temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n\n                if j != n - 1:\n                    temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n```\n\nThe next line finds the minimum value in the `temp` list and assigns it to the `val` variable.\n\n```python\n                val = min(temp)\n```\n\nThe next three lines initialize an empty list called `ans` and then iterate `k` times. If the current iteration is even, it appends `1` to the `ans` list. If the current iteration is odd, it appends the value of `val` to the `ans` list.\n\n```python\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            ans.append(1)\n        else:\n            ans.append(val)\n```\n\nThe last line of the function returns the `ans` list.\n\n```python\n    return ans\n```\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> minPath(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long k) {\n"

The function signature specifies that `s` is of type `str` and the output is also of type `str`.\n\nThe string `d` is defined as a string of all lowercase letters of the English alphabet. \n\nAn empty string `out` is initialized.\n\nThe for loop iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`. \n\nIf the character `c` is a letter in the English alphabet, then the following line is executed:\n\n```python\nout += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]\n```\n\nThis line finds the index of the character `c` in the string `d` using the `index` method. It then adds `4` to this index (i.e. `2*2`) and takes the result modulo `26`. This gives a new index in the range `0` to `25`. The character at this new index in the string `d` is then appended to the output string `out`.\n\nIf the character `c` is not a letter in the English alphabet, then the following line is executed:\n\n```python\nout += c\n```\n\nThis line simply appends the character `c` to the output string `out`.\n\nFinally, the output string `out` is returned.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encrypt(std::string s) {\n"

The list contains `n` elements, where each element is equal to `n + 2*i`, where `i` is the index of the element in the list.\n\nHere is a line-by-line explanation of the code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThis line imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. The `List` class is used to indicate that the function returns a list of integers.\n\n```python\ndef make_a_pile(n: int) -> List[int]:\n```\n\nThis line defines the `make_a_pile` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers. The `-> List[int]` syntax indicates that the function returns a list of integers.\n\n```python\nreturn [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]\n```\n\nThis line creates a list of integers using a list comprehension. The list contains `n` elements, where each element is equal to `n + 2*i`, where `i` is the index of the element in the list. The `range(n)` function returns a sequence of integers from `0` to `n-1`, which is used to generate the indices `i` for each element in the list.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> make_a_pile(long n) {\n"

Can you explain what this Python program does line by line? The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Python version\n\ndef is_prime(n:int) -> bool:\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for k in range(2, n - 1):\n        if n % k == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not. The function takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input is prime or not.\n\nThe first line of the function definition specifies the function name, \"is_prime\", and the input parameter, \"n\", which is an integer. The \"-> bool\" specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\nThe next line checks if the input number is less than 2. If it is, the function returns False, since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.\n\nThe for loop iterates over a range of numbers from 2 to n-1. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from the start value (2) up to, but not including, the end value (n-1). The loop variable \"k\" takes on each value in the sequence, and the loop body checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, the function returns False, since n is not a prime number.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding a factor of n, the function returns True, indicating that n is a prime number.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n"
