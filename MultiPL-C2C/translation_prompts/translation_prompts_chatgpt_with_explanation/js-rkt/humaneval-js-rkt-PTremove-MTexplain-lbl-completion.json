The function takes a string of brackets as an argument.\n2. A variable `depth` is initialized to 0.\n3. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the string of brackets.\n4. If the current character is an opening bracket (i.e. '('), the `depth` variable is incremented by 1.\n5. If the current character is a closing bracket (i.e. ')'), the `depth` variable is decremented by 1.\n6. If the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns false.\n7.

Math.max(...smallest) : null, largest.length ? Math.min(...largest) : null]\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of two integers, the largest negative integer in the input list and the smallest positive integer in the input list. If the input list does not contain any negative integers, the first element of the output list is null. If the input list does not contain any positive integers, the second element of the output list is null.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. The function takes a list of integers as input and assigns it to the variable `lst`.\n2. The function filters the input list to create a new list `smallest` that contains only the negative integers in the input list. This is done using the `filter` method of the input list, which takes a function as an argument that returns `true` if the element should be included in the filtered list and `false` otherwise. In this case, the function checks if the element is less than zero (`x < 0`).\n3. The function filters the input list to create a new list `largest` that contains only the positive integers in the input list. This is done using the same method as in step 2, but with a different condition (`x > 0`).\n4. The function returns a list containing the largest negative integer in the `smallest` list (if it exists) and the smallest positive integer in the `largest` list (if it exists). This is done using the `Math.max` and `Math.min` functions, which return the maximum and minimum value in an array, respectively. If the `smallest` list is empty, the first element of the output list is null. If the `largest` list is empty, the second element of the output list is null.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (largest_smallest_integers lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_109_move_one_ball", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (move_one_ball arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_109_move_one_ball.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate move_one_ball))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 4 5 1 2)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 5 10 1 2)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 4 3 1 2)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 5 4 1 2)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) #t 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if it is possible to sort the array by moving only one element to a different position. If it is possible, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the input array is empty. If it is, the function returns `true` because an empty array is already sorted. If the array is not empty, the function creates a copy of the input array and sorts it in ascending order. The sorted array is stored in a variable called `sorted_array`.\n\nNext, the function initializes an empty array called `my_arr`. The function finds the minimum value in the input array using the `Math.min` function and stores it in a variable called `min_value`. The function finds the index of the minimum value in the input array using the `indexOf` function and stores it in a variable called `min_index`.\n\nThe function creates a new array called `my_arr` by concatenating two slices of the input array. The first slice starts at the index of the minimum value and goes to the end of the array. The second slice starts at the beginning of the array and goes up to, but not including, the index of the minimum value. This creates a new array where the minimum value is at the beginning and the rest of the values are shifted to the right.\n\nFinally, the function loops through the input array and compares each element of `my_arr` to the corresponding element of `sorted_array`. If any of the elements are different, the function returns `false` because it is not possible to sort the array by moving only one element. If all of the elements are the same, the function returns `true` because it is possible to sort the array by moving only one element.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (move_one_ball arr)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_131_digits", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (digits n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_131_digits.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate digits))\n    (check-within (candidate 5) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 54) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 120) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5014) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 98765) 315 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5576543) 2625 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2468) 0 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.\n\nThe function initializes an array `results` with the first four numbers in the sequence: 0, 0, 2, 0. The first two zeros are used to calculate the fourth number in the sequence, which is 2. The last zero is a placeholder that will be replaced with the next number in the sequence.\n\nIf `n` is less than 4, the function returns the corresponding number in the `results` array. Otherwise, the function enters a loop that calculates the next number in the sequence. The loop starts at 4 and continues until `n`. \n\nIn each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the sum of the four numbers in the `results` array and stores it in a variable `sum`. The function then removes the first number in the `results` array using the `shift` method, and adds the `sum` to the end of the array using the `push` method. This effectively shifts the array to the left and replaces the last zero with the next number in the sequence.\n\nAfter the loop completes, the function returns the last number in the `results` array, which is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. In this implementation, the `n`th number is always stored in the fourth position of the `results` array, so the function returns `results[3]`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (fib4 n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_145_order_by_points", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (order_by_points nums)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_145_order_by_points.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate order_by_points))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 11 -1 -11 -12)) (list -1 -11 1 -12 11) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1234 423 463 145 2 423 423 53 6 37 3457 3 56 0 46)) (list 0 2 3 6 53 423 423 423 1234 145 37 46 56 463 3457) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 -11 -32 43 54 -98 2 -3)) (list -3 -32 -98 -11 1 2 43 54) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11)) (list 1 10 2 11 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 6 6 -76 -21 23 4)) (list -76 -21 0 4 23 6 6) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two arguments, `x` and `shift`. `x` is the number to be shifted and `shift` is the number of positions to shift `x` to the left. \n\nThe function first converts the number `x` to a string and assigns it to the variable `s`. \n\nThe function then checks if the value of `shift` is greater than the length of the string `s`. If it is, the function reverses the string `s`, converts it back to a number and returns it. This is because if the shift value is greater than the length of the string, the circular shift will wrap around the entire string and end up back where it started. \n\nIf the value of `shift` is less than or equal to the length of the string `s`, the function slices the string `s` into two parts: the first part is the substring from the end of the string to the position `s.length-shift`, and the second part is the substring from the beginning of the string to the position `s.length-shift`. The function then concatenates the two substrings and returns the result. This is because if the shift value is less than or equal to the length of the string, the circular shift will only shift the string by the specified number of positions. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (circular_shift x shift)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_115_max_fill", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (max_fill grid capacity)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_115_max_fill.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate max_fill))\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 0 0 1 0) (list 0 1 0 0) (list 1 1 1 1)) 1) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 0 0 1 1) (list 0 0 0 0) (list 1 1 1 1) (list 0 1 1 1)) 2) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0)) 5) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 1 1 1) (list 1 1 1 1)) 2) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 1 1 1) (list 1 1 1 1)) 9) 2 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the maximum number of times the capacity can be filled in the 2D array.\n\n1. `function max_fill(grid, capacity){` - This line declares a function called `max_fill` that takes in two parameters, `grid` and `capacity`.\n\n2. `return grid.reduce((acc, arr) => acc + Math.ceil(arr.reduce((a,b) => a+b)/capacity), 0);` - This line returns the result of the reduce method applied to the `grid` parameter.\n\n3. `grid.reduce` - This method applies a function to each element of the `grid` array and returns a single value. \n\n4. `(acc, arr) => acc + Math.ceil(arr.reduce((a,b) => a+b)/capacity)` - This is the function that is applied to each element of the `grid` array. It takes in two parameters, `acc` and `arr`. `acc` is the accumulator that stores the result of the previous iteration of the reduce method. `arr` is the current element of the `grid` array that is being processed. \n\n5. `Math.ceil(arr.reduce((a,b) => a+b)/capacity)` - This line calculates the number of times the capacity can be filled in the current element of the `grid` array. It does this by first applying the `reduce` method to the current element of the `grid` array. The `reduce` method takes in a function that adds up all the elements of the current element of the `grid` array. The result of this is then divided by the `capacity` parameter. The `Math.ceil` method is then applied to round up the result to the nearest integer.\n\n6. `, 0);` - This line sets the initial value of the accumulator to 0.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (max_fill grid capacity)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_0_has_close_elements", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (has_close_elements numbers threshold)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_0_has_close_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate has_close_elements))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2) 0.3) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2) 0.05) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0) 0.95) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0) 0.8) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0) 0.1) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1) 1.0) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1) 0.5) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an array of words if the input string contains spaces, an array of words if the input string contains commas, and the number of even-indexed letters in the input string if it contains neither spaces nor commas.\n\n1. `function split_words(txt){`: This line defines the function `split_words` that takes a string `txt` as input.\n2. `if(txt.includes(\" \")){`: This line checks if the input string contains spaces.\n3. `return txt.split(\" \");`: This line returns an array of words if the input string contains spaces. The `split` method is called on the input string with a space as the delimiter.\n4. `}else if(txt.includes(\",\")){`: This line checks if the input string contains commas.\n5. `return txt.replace(/,/g, \" \").split(\" \");`: This line returns an array of words if the input string contains commas. The `replace` method is called on the input string with a regular expression that matches all commas and replaces them with spaces. The resulting string is then split into an array of words using the `split` method with a space as the delimiter.\n6. `}else{`: This line is executed if the input string contains neither spaces nor commas.\n7. `return [...txt].filter(i => i.match(/[a-z]/) && i.charCodeAt(0)%2 == 0).length;`: This line returns the number of even-indexed letters in the input string. The input string is first converted to an array of characters using the spread operator (`...`). The resulting array is then filtered to include only characters that are lowercase letters (`i.match(/[a-z]/)`) and have an even index (`i.charCodeAt(0)%2 == 0`). The length of the resulting array is returned. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (split_words txt)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_16_count_distinct_characters", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (count_distinct_characters string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_16_count_distinct_characters.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate count_distinct_characters))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcde\") 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcdecadeCADE\") 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"aaaaAAAAaaaa\") 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Jerry jERRY JeRRRY\") 5 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `count_distinct_characters` and takes a single argument `string`.\n2. The function returns the size of a new `Set` object created from the string. \n3. The `Set` object is created by passing the string to the `Set` constructor, which returns a new `Set` object containing the unique characters in the string. \n4. The `toLowerCase()` method is called on the string before it is passed to the `Set` constructor to ensure that all characters are in lowercase. \n5.

The function returns an array of planet names that are between `planet1` and `planet2` in the solar system. If `planet1` and `planet2` are not valid planet names or they are the same planet, the function returns an empty array.\n\n1. `let planet_names = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"];` - initializes an array of planet names in the solar system.\n\n2. `if(!planet_names.includes(planet1) || !planet_names.includes(planet2) || planet1 == planet2){ return []; }` - checks if `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names and they are not the same planet. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an empty array.\n\n3. `let planet1_index = planet_names.indexOf(planet1);` - gets the index of `planet1` in the `planet_names` array.\n\n4. `let planet2_index = planet_names.indexOf(planet2);` - gets the index of `planet2` in the `planet_names` array.\n\n5. `if(planet1_index < planet2_index){ return planet_names.slice(planet1_index+1, planet2_index); }else{ return planet_names.slice(planet2_index+1, planet1_index); }` - checks if `planet1` comes before `planet2` in the `planet_names` array. If it does, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` array from the index of `planet1` plus one to the index of `planet2`. If it does not, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` array from the index of `planet2` plus one to the index of `planet1`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (bf planet1 planet2)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_66_digitSum", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (digitSum s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_66_digitSum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate digitSum))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abAB\") 131 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcCd\") 67 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"helloE\") 69 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"woArBld\") 131 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"aAaaaXa\") 153 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \" How are yOu?\") 151 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"You arE Very Smart\") 327 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the string is empty, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns 0. If it is not empty, the function splits the string into an array of characters using the `split` method. The `reduce` method is then called on the resulting array, with an initial value of 0.\n\nThe `reduce` method takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value. The callback function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current value of the array being processed. The callback function returns the updated value of the accumulator.\n\nIn this case, the callback function checks if the current character is an uppercase letter using a regular expression (`/[A-Z]/`). If it is, the ASCII value of the character is added to the accumulator using the `charCodeAt` method. If it is not an uppercase letter, 0 is added to the accumulator.\n\nAfter all characters have been processed, the final value of the accumulator is returned as the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase letters in the input string. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (digitSum s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_142_sum_squares", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (sum_squares lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_142_sum_squares.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate sum_squares))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3)) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 4 9)) 14 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)) 9 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1)) -3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -5 2 -1 -5)) -126 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -56 -99 1 0 -2)) 3030 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -16 -9 -2 36 36 26 -20 25 -40 20 -4 12 -26 35 37)) -14196 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -3 17 -1 -15 13 -1 14 -14 -12 -5 14 -14 6 13 11 16 16 4 10)) -1448 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The loop is controlled by a variable `i` that starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the length of the input list. \n\nInside the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if the current value of `i` is divisible by 3 with no remainder. If it is, then the square of the current element is appended to the `result` array using the `push` method. \n\nIf the current value of `i` is not divisible by 3, the code enters an `else if` statement that checks if the current value of `i` is divisible by 4 with no remainder and is not divisible by 3 with no remainder. If it is, then the cube of the current element is appended to the `result` array using the `push` method. \n\nIf neither of the above conditions are met, then the current element is simply appended to the `result` array using the `push` method. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the elements of the `result` array using the `reduce` method. The `reduce` method takes two arguments: a callback function that specifies how to combine the elements of the array, and an initial value of 0. In this case, the callback function is an arrow function that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The initial value of 0 ensures that the `reduce` method starts with a sum of 0. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (sum_squares lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_96_count_up_to", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (count_up_to n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_96_count_up_to.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate count_up_to))\n    (check-within (candidate 5) (list 2 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) (list 2 3 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7) (list 2 3 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) (list 2 3 5 7) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 0) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 22) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 18) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 47) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 101) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

After the inner `for` loop, check if `is_prime` is still `true`. If it is, `i` is a prime number, so add it to the `primes` array using the `push` method.\n8.

The function is defined with the name `unique` and takes a single parameter `l`.\n2. The function returns a new list with only the unique numbers sorted in ascending order.\n3. The `new Set(l)` creates a new set object with the elements of the list `l`. A set is a collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements in `l` are removed.\n4. The spread operator `...` is used to convert the set back to an array.\n5. The `sort()` method is called on the array to sort the elements in ascending order. The `sort()` method takes a function as an argument that compares two elements and returns a negative, zero, or positive number depending on the order of the elements. In this case, the function `(a,b) => a-b` compares two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a negative number if `a` is less than `b`, zero if `a` is equal to `b`, and a positive number if `a` is greater than `b`.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on. \n\nThe function `fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nThe first two `if` statements check if `n` is 0 or 1. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. \n\nIf `n` is not 0 or 1, the function returns the sum of the two preceding numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. This is done by recursively calling the `fib` function with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and adding the results together. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (fib n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_36_fizz_buzz", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (fizz_buzz n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_36_fizz_buzz.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate fizz_buzz))\n    (check-within (candidate 50) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 78) 2 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 79) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 200) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4000) 192 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10000) 639 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100000) 8026 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two arguments: `class_name` and `extensions`. `class_name` is a string and `extensions` is an array of strings. The function returns a string that is the concatenation of `class_name` and the string in `extensions` that has the most uppercase letters relative to its lowercase letters.\n\nThe function starts by declaring a variable called `strong` and setting it equal to the first element in the `extensions` array. It then declares a variable called `my_val` and sets it equal to the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in `strong`. This is done using the `replace` method to remove all non-uppercase and non-lowercase letters from `strong` and then taking the difference in length between the original string and the modified string.\n\nThe function then enters a `for` loop that iterates over each element in the `extensions` array. For each element, it calculates the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in the same way as it did for `strong`. If this difference is greater than `my_val`, it sets `strong` equal to the current element and updates `my_val` to the new difference.\n\nFinally, the function concatenates `class_name` and `strong` with a period in between and returns the resulting string.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (Strongest_Extension class_name extensions)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (find_closest_elements numbers)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate find_closest_elements))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2)) (list 3.9 4.0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0)) (list 5.0 5.9) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.2)) (list 2.0 2.2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0)) (list 2.0 2.0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1)) (list 2.2 3.1) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

These variables will be used to keep track of the closest pair of numbers and the distance between them, respectively.\n\nThe function then uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of numbers in the input array. For each pair of numbers, the function calculates the absolute difference between them using the `Math.abs()` function and stores it in a variable called `new_distance`.\n\nIf `distance` is `null`, the function sets `distance` to `new_distance` and `closest_pair` to the current pair of numbers, sorted in ascending order. If `new_distance` is less than `distance`, the function updates `distance` to `new_distance` and `closest_pair` to the current pair of numbers, sorted in ascending order.\n\nFinally, the function returns `closest_pair`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (find_closest_elements numbers)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_124_valid_date", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (valid_date date)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_124_valid_date.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate valid_date))\n    (check-within (candidate \"03-11-2000\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"15-01-2012\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"04-0-2040\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"06-04-2020\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"01-01-2007\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"03-32-2011\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"04-31-3000\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"06-06-2005\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"21-31-2000\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"04-12-2003\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"04122003\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"20030412\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"2003-04\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"2003-04-12\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"04-2003\") #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.\n\nThe function initializes a variable called `ans` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of changes needed to make the array a palindrome.\n\nThe function then loops through the first half of the array using a `for` loop. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the array divided by 2. This is because we only need to check the first half of the array, since the second half is just a mirror image of the first half.\n\nInside the loop, the function checks if the element at index `i` is not equal to the element at the corresponding index in the second half of the array (which is `arr.length-i-1`). If the two elements are not equal, it means that a change needs to be made to one of them so that they become equal. The function increments the `ans` variable by 1 to keep track of the number of changes needed.\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is the smallest number of changes needed to make the array a palindrome.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (smallest_change arr)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_52_below_threshold", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (below_threshold l t)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_52_below_threshold.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate below_threshold))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 4 10) 100) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 20 4 10) 5) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 20 4 10) 21) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 20 4 10) 22) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 8 4 10) 11) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 8 4 10) 10) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are less than the threshold. \n\nThe function uses the `every` method of the `Array` object to check whether all elements in the list satisfy the condition of being less than the threshold. The `every` method returns `true` if all elements in the array satisfy the condition, and `false` otherwise. \n\nThe function uses an arrow function to define the condition that each element in the list must satisfy. The arrow function takes a single argument `e` and returns the result of the comparison `e < t`. \n\nThe function returns the result of the `every` method call, which is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are less than the threshold. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (below_threshold l t)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_128_prod_signs", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (prod_signs arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_128_prod_signs.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate prod_signs))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 2 -4)) -9 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 1)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 1 1 2 3 -1 1)) -10 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 1 2 -1 -1 9)) 20 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 1 -1 1)) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 1 1 1)) -4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 1 1 0)) 0 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The integer `i` is first converted to a string using `String(i)`, then spread into an array using `[...]`. The `every` method is then called on this array with an arrow function that checks if each digit is odd. If every digit is odd, the arrow function returns `true`, and the `every` method returns `true`. If any digit is even, the arrow function returns `false`, and the `every` method returns `false`. If the `every` method returns `true`, the if statement is true and the code inside the if statement is executed.\n\n5. `odd_digit_elements.push(i);`: This pushes the integer `i` into the `odd_digit_elements` array.\n\n6. `return odd_digit_elements.sort((a,b) => a-b);`: This returns the `odd_digit_elements` array sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method with an arrow function that subtracts `b` from `a`. This sorts the array in ascending order because if `a` is greater than `b`, the result of the subtraction will be positive, and `a` will be placed after `b` in the sorted array. If `a` is less than `b`, the result of the subtraction will be negative, and `a` will be placed before `b` in the sorted array.

The function takes two arguments, an array and a number k. If k is zero, an empty array is returned. If k is greater than zero, the function sorts the array in ascending order and returns the last k elements of the sorted array.\n\n1. Declare a function called `maximum` that takes two arguments, `arr` and `k`.\n2. If `k` is equal to 0, return an empty array.\n3. Sort the array in ascending order using the `sort` method. The `sort` method takes a callback function that compares two elements of the array and returns a negative number if the first element is less than the second, a positive number if the first element is greater than the second, and 0 if the two elements are equal. In this case, the callback function is an arrow function that subtracts `b` from `a`, resulting in ascending order.\n4. Return the last `k` elements of the sorted array using the `slice` method. The `slice` method takes two arguments, the starting index and the ending index of the slice. In this case, the starting index is `-k`, which means the slice starts from the end of the array and goes backwards `k` elements. The ending index is not specified, which means the slice goes to the end of the array.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (maximum arr k)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_1_separate_paren_groups", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (separate_paren_groups paren_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_1_separate_paren_groups.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate separate_paren_groups))\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\") (list \"(()())\" \"((()))\" \"()\" \"((())()())\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"() (()) ((())) (((())))\") (list \"()\" \"(())\" \"((()))\" \"(((())))\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()(())((())))\") (list \"(()(())((())))\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\") (list \"()\" \"(())\" \"(()())\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction separate_paren_groups(paren_string){\n```\n\nThis line defines a function called `separate_paren_groups` that takes a single argument called `paren_string`.\n\n```javascript\nlet result = [];\nlet current_string = [];\nlet current_depth = 0;\n```\n\nThese lines define three variables: `result`, `current_string`, and `current_depth`. `result` is an empty array that will eventually hold the groups of parentheses. `current_string` is an empty array that will be used to build up each group of parentheses. `current_depth` is a counter that keeps track of the current depth of the parentheses.\n\n```javascript\nfor(let c of paren_string){\n```\n\nThis line starts a `for` loop that iterates over each character in the `paren_string`.\n\n```javascript\nif(c === '('){\n  current_depth += 1;\n  current_string.push(c);\n} else if(c === ')'){\n  current_depth -= 1;\n  current_string.push(c);\n\n  if(current_depth === 0){\n    result.push(current_string.join(''));\n    current_string = [];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese lines are the main logic of the function. If the current character is an open parenthesis (`(`), then we increment the `current_depth` counter and add the character to the `current_string` array. If the current character is a close parenthesis (`)`), then we decrement the `current_depth` counter and add the character to the `current_string` array. If the `current_depth` counter reaches 0, then we know that we have reached the end of a group of parentheses, so we join the `current_string` array into a single string and add it to the `result` array. We also reset the `current_string` array to an empty array so that we can start building up the next group of parentheses.\n\n```javascript\nreturn result;\n```\n\nThis line returns the `result` array, which contains all of the groups of parentheses in the original string.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (separate_paren_groups paren_string)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_22_filter_integers", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (filter_integers values)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_22_filter_integers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate filter_integers))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 4 #hash() (list ) 23.2 9 \"adasd\")) (list 4 9) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 \"c\" 3 3 \"a\" \"b\")) (list 3 3 3) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the input integer is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of the input integer. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the input integer is not prime. If the function completes the loop without finding any divisors, it returns true, indicating that the input integer is prime.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable called `maxx` to 0. It then iterates over each element in the input list using the `forEach` method. For each element, the function checks if it is greater than `maxx` and if it is prime using the `isPrime` function. If both conditions are true, `maxx` is updated to the current element.\n\nFinally, the function converts `maxx` to a string, splits the string into an array of characters, and uses the `reduce` method to sum the digits of the number. The `reduce` method takes a function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The `reduce` method applies this function to each element of the array, accumulating the sum of the digits. The final result is returned as an integer.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (skjkasdkd lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_74_total_match", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (total_match lst1 lst2)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_74_total_match.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate total_match))\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hi\" \"hi\")) (list \"hi\" \"hi\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hi\" \"hi\" \"admin\" \"project\")) (list \"hi\" \"admin\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"4\") (list \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\")) (list \"4\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hI\" \"Hi\")) (list \"hI\" \"Hi\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hI\" \"hi\" \"hi\")) (list \"hI\" \"hi\" \"hi\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hI\" \"hi\" \"hii\")) (list \"hi\" \"admin\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) (list \"this\")) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"this\") (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two arguments, `x` and `n`.\n\n1. `function is_simple_power(x, n){` - declares a function named `is_simple_power` that takes two arguments, `x` and `n`.\n2. `if(n == 1){` - checks if `n` is equal to 1.\n3. `return x == 1;` - if `n` is equal to 1, returns a boolean indicating if `x` is also equal to 1.\n4. `let power = 1;` - declares a variable named `power` and initializes it to 1.\n5. `while(power < x){` - enters a loop that continues while `power` is less than `x`.\n6. `power *= n;` - multiplies `power` by `n`.\n7. `}` - ends the loop.\n8. `return power == x;` - returns a boolean indicating if `power` is equal to `x`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (is_simple_power x n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_93_encode", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (encode message)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_93_encode.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate encode))\n    (check-within (candidate \"TEST\") \"tgst\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Mudasir\") \"mWDCSKR\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"YES\") \"ygs\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"This is a message\") \"tHKS KS C MGSSCGG\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE\") \"k dQnT kNqW wHcT Tq wRkTg\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The encoding is done in two steps. \n\nThe first step is to replace all vowels in the message with the letter that comes two letters after it in the alphabet. For example, the letter 'a' is replaced with the letter 'c', the letter 'e' is replaced with the letter 'g', and so on. \n\nThe second step is to convert all uppercase letters in the message to lowercase letters, and all lowercase letters to uppercase letters. \n\nHere is a line-by-line explanation of the code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction encode(message){\n```\nThis line defines a function called `encode` that takes a single parameter called `message`.\n\n```javascript\n  const vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\";\n```\nThis line defines a constant variable called `vowels` that contains all the vowels in the English alphabet, both uppercase and lowercase.\n\n```javascript\n  const vowelsReplace = Object.fromEntries([...vowels].map(v => [v, String.fromCharCode(v.charCodeAt(0) + 2)]));\n```\nThis line defines a constant variable called `vowelsReplace` that is an object containing key-value pairs. Each key is a vowel from the `vowels` string, and each value is the letter that comes two letters after the corresponding vowel in the alphabet. This is done using the `map` function to iterate over each vowel in the `vowels` string, and the `String.fromCharCode` function to convert the ASCII code of the letter to a string.\n\n```javascript\n  message = message.split('').map(c => vowelsReplace[c] || c).join('');\n```\nThis line replaces all vowels in the `message` string with the corresponding letter from the `vowelsReplace` object. This is done using the `split` function to convert the `message` string into an array of characters, the `map` function to iterate over each character in the array, and the `||` operator to return the original character if it is not a vowel. The resulting array is then converted back into a string using the `join` function.\n\n```javascript\n  return message.split('').map(c => c === c.toUpperCase() ? c.toLowerCase() : c.toUpperCase()).join('');\n```\nThis line converts all uppercase letters in the `message` string to lowercase letters, and all lowercase letters to uppercase letters. This is done using the `split` function to convert the `message` string into an array of characters, the `map` function to iterate over each character in the array, and a ternary operator to check if the character is uppercase or lowercase. The resulting array is then converted back into a string using the `join` function.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (encode message)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_42_incr_list", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (incr_list l)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_42_incr_list.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate incr_list))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1)) (list 4 3 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 2 5 2 3 3 9 0 123)) (list 6 3 6 3 4 4 10 1 124) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new list, where each element of the input list `l` has been incremented by 1. \n\nThe function uses the `map` method of the input list `l` to create a new list. The `map` method applies a function to each element of the input list and returns a new list with the results. In this case, the function being applied is an arrow function `e => e+1`, which takes an element `e` of the input list and returns the value of `e+1`. \n\nThe function `incr_list` returns the new list created by the `map` method.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (incr_list l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_27_flip_case", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (flip_case string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_27_flip_case.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate flip_case))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hello!\") \"hELLO!\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"These violent delights have violent ends\") \"tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `is_palindrome` converts the number to a string, splits the string into an array of characters, reverses the array, and joins the array back into a string. If the resulting string is equal to the original string, then the number is a palindrome and the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe function `even_odd_palindrome` initializes two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to zero. It then loops through the numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. For each number, it checks whether it is odd or even using the modulo operator `%`. If the number is odd and a palindrome, it increments `odd_palindrome_count`. If the number is even and a palindrome, it increments `even_palindrome_count`.\n\nFinally, the function returns an array containing `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (even_odd_palindrome n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_71_triangle_area", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (triangle_area a b c)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_71_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate triangle_area))\n    (check-within (candidate 3 4 5) 6.0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2 10) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 8 5) 8.18 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 2) 1.73 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2 3) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 5 7) 16.25 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 6 3) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 1 1) 0.43 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 10) -1 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Heron's formula is used to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides. The formula is:\n\narea = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))\n\nwhere s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is half the perimeter of the triangle.

The function `tri` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an array of `n` triangular numbers. \n\n1. The function starts by checking if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns an array with a single element, 1. This is the base case of the sequence.\n2. If `n` is not 0, the function initializes an array `my_tri` with the first two elements of the sequence, 1 and 3.\n3. The function then enters a loop that runs `n` times. The loop starts at 2 and ends at `n+1` because the first two elements of the sequence have already been added to `my_tri`.\n4. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current index `i` is even. If it is, the function calculates the triangular number at that index by dividing `i` by 2 and adding 1. This is because every even index in the sequence is equal to the sum of the two previous odd indices.\n5. If `i` is odd, the function calculates the triangular number at that index by adding the previous two elements in the sequence and adding `(i+3)/2`. This is because every odd index in the sequence is equal to the sum of the previous even index and the two previous odd indices.\n6. The function then pushes the calculated triangular number to the `my_tri` array.\n7. After the loop has finished, the function returns the `my_tri` array.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (tri n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_47_median", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (median l)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_47_median.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate median))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 1 2 4 5)) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -10 4 6 1000 10 20)) 8.0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5)) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 6 5)) 5.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 8 1 3 9 9 2 7)) 7 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median of the list. The median is the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe function starts by sorting the input list in ascending order. This is done using the `sort` method of the list object. The `sort` method takes a comparison function as input, which is used to determine the order of the elements. In this case, the comparison function is an arrow function that subtracts the second element from the first element (`(a,b) => a-b`). This sorts the list in ascending order.\n\nThe function then checks if the length of the list is odd or even. This is done using the modulo operator (`%`). If the length is odd, the function returns the middle element of the sorted list. This is done using the `floor` method of the `Math` object to round down to the nearest integer (`Math.floor(l.length/2)`). If the length is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements of the sorted list. This is done by adding the two middle elements and dividing by two (`(l[l.length/2-1] + l[l.length/2])/2`).\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (median l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_44_change_base", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (change_base x base)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_44_change_base.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate change_base))\n    (check-within (candidate 8 3) \"22\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 9 3) \"100\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 234 2) \"11101010\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 16 2) \"10000\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8 2) \"1000\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 2) \"111\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 3) \"2\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3 4) \"3\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 5) \"4\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5 6) \"5\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6 7) \"6\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 8) \"7\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The sorting is based on two criteria: the number of 1s in the binary representation of the integer, and the integer value itself.\n\nThe function takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array.\n\nThe sorting is done using the `sort` method of the array object. The `sort` method takes a function as an argument, which is used to compare the elements of the array.\n\nThe comparison function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are the elements being compared. The function returns a negative value if `a` should come before `b`, a positive value if `a` should come after `b`, and 0 if `a` and `b` are equal.\n\nThe comparison function first calculates the number of 1s in the binary representation of `a` and `b`. This is done by converting the integers to binary strings using the `toString` method with a base of 2, and then using the `match` method with a regular expression to count the number of 1s in the string. If there are no 1s in the string, the `match` method returns `null`, so the `|| []` part of the expression converts `null` to an empty array.\n\nThe comparison function then subtracts the number of 1s in the binary representation of `b` from the number of 1s in the binary representation of `a`. This ensures that integers with fewer 1s in their binary representation come before integers with more 1s.\n\nIf the number of 1s in the binary representation of `a` and `b` is the same, the comparison function subtracts `b` from `a`. This ensures that integers with smaller values come before integers with larger values.\n\nFinally, the `sort` method returns the sorted array.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (sort_array arr)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_58_common", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (common l1 l2)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_58_common.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate common))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 4 3 34 653 2 5) (list 5 7 1 5 9 653 121)) (list 1 5 653) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 3 2 8) (list 3 2)) (list 2 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 4 3 2 8) (list 3 2 4)) (list 2 3 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 4 3 2 8) (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if `b` is a cyclic pattern of `a`. A cyclic pattern is a pattern that can be obtained by rotating a string any number of times. For example, \"abcabc\" is a cyclic pattern of \"abc\".\n\nThe function works by first calculating the length of `b` and then creating a new string called `pat` by concatenating `b` with itself. This is done to ensure that all possible cyclic patterns of `b` are included in `pat`.\n\nThe function then uses two nested loops to compare all possible substrings of `a` with `pat`. The outer loop iterates over all possible starting positions of `a` where a substring of length `l` (the length of `b`) can be extracted. The inner loop iterates over all possible starting positions of `pat` where a substring of length `l` can be extracted.\n\nIf the substring of `a` matches the substring of `pat`, then the function returns `true`, indicating that `b` is a cyclic pattern of `a`.

[] : array.sort((a,b)=>(array[0]+array[array.length-1])%2==0 ? b-a : a-b);\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that sorts an array of integers in a specific way. The function takes an array as an argument and returns a sorted array. If the input array is empty, the function returns an empty array.\n\nThe sorting algorithm is based on the parity of the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is even, the array is sorted in descending order. If the sum is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe function first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, it returns an empty array. If it is not, it sorts the array using the sort() method. The sort() method takes a comparison function as an argument, which determines the order of the elements in the sorted array.\n\nThe comparison function takes two arguments, a and b, which represent two elements of the array. The function calculates the parity of the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is even, the function returns b-a, which sorts the array in descending order. If the sum is odd, the function returns a-b, which sorts the array in ascending order.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (sort_array array)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_111_histogram", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (histogram test)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_111_histogram.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate histogram))\n    (check-within (candidate \"a b b a\") #hash((\"a\" .  2) (\"b\" .  2)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a b c a b\") #hash((\"a\" .  2) (\"b\" .  2)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a b c d g\") #hash((\"a\" .  1) (\"b\" .  1) (\"c\" .  1) (\"d\" .  1) (\"g\" .  1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"r t g\") #hash((\"r\" .  1) (\"t\" .  1) (\"g\" .  1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"b b b b a\") #hash((\"b\" .  4)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"r t g\") #hash((\"r\" .  1) (\"t\" .  1) (\"g\" .  1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") #hash() 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a\") #hash((\"a\" .  1)) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The conjecture states that for any positive integer n, the sequence of numbers obtained by repeatedly applying the following function will eventually reach 1:\n\nf(n) = n/2 if n is even\nf(n) = 3n + 1 if n is odd\n\nThe function `get_odd_collatz` takes a single argument `n` and returns an array of the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. \n\nThe first line of the function initializes an empty array `odd_collatz` if `n` is even, or an array containing `n` if `n` is odd. This is done using a ternary operator that checks if `n%2` is equal to 0.\n\nThe next line starts a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is even or odd using another ternary operator. If `n` is even, it is divided by 2. If `n` is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added to the result. \n\nThe final if statement checks if `n` is odd. If it is, `n` is added to the `odd_collatz` array using the `push` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `odd_collatz` array sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method with a callback function that compares two values and returns a negative number if the first value is less than the second, 0 if they are equal, and a positive number if the first value is greater than the second. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (get_odd_collatz n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_62_derivative", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (derivative xs)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_62_derivative.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate derivative))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 1 2 4 5)) (list 1 4 12 20) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3)) (list 2 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1)) (list 2 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1 0 4)) (list 2 2 0 16) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1)) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new array of numbers that represents the derivative of the input array. \n\nThe derivative of a function is the rate at which the function changes at each point. In this case, the derivative of an array of numbers is the rate at which the values in the array change at each index. \n\nThe function uses the `map` method to create a new array of numbers. The `map` method applies a function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results. In this case, the function takes two arguments: `x` and `i`. `x` is the value of the current element in the array, and `i` is the index of the current element in the array. The function multiplies `x` by `i` and returns the result. This means that the first element of the new array will be `0`, since `0*0=0`. The second element will be `1*x[1]`, the third element will be `2*x[2]`, and so on. \n\nThe `slice` method is then used to remove the first element of the new array. This is because the first element of the new array represents the derivative of the first element of the input array, which is always `0`. The remaining elements of the new array represent the derivative of the input array at each index. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (derivative xs)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_63_fibfib", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (fibfib n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_63_fibfib.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate fibfib))\n    (check-within (candidate 2) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) 24 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) 81 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12) 274 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 14) 927 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The function takes a single argument `n` which is the index of the number in the sequence to be returned. \n\nThe function begins by checking if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0. This is because the first number in the sequence is 0. \n\nThe function then checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 0. This is because the second number in the sequence is 1. \n\nThe function then checks if `n` is equal to 2. If it is, the function returns 1. This is because the third number in the sequence is 1. \n\nIf `n` is not equal to 0, 1, or 2, the function recursively calls itself three times with `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-3` as arguments. The results of these recursive calls are added together and returned as the result of the function. This is because the nth number in the sequence is the sum of the three preceding numbers. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (fibfib n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_2_truncate_number", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (truncate_number number)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_2_truncate_number.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate truncate_number))\n    (check-within (candidate 3.5) 0.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1.25) 0.25 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 123.0) 0.0 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the remainder of the division of `number` by 1. \n\nThe `%` operator in JavaScript is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. In this case, the number 1 is being divided by `number`. \n\nThe function is a simple way to extract the decimal part of a number.

It does this by repeatedly removing the last character of the string until the last character is not '0'.\n\n```javascript\n  let num = parseFloat(value);\n```\n\nThis line converts the `value` string to a floating point number and assigns it to the variable `num`.\n\n```javascript\n  if(value.slice(-2) == '.5'){\n```\n\nThis line checks if the `value` string ends with the string '.5'. If it does, the number represented by the string is halfway between two integers.\n\n```javascript\n    if(num > 0){\n      return Math.ceil(num);\n    }else{\n      return Math.floor(num);\n    }\n```\n\nIf the number represented by the string is greater than 0, the function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number (i.e. the ceiling of the number).

The function returns the second smallest number in the list. If the list has only one unique number, the function returns null.\n\nThe first line of the function creates a new list by removing duplicates from the input list. The `new Set(lst)` creates a new set object from the input list, which automatically removes duplicates. The `...` syntax is the spread operator, which is used to spread the elements of the set into a new array. The resulting array is then sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method. The `sort()` method takes a function as an argument that compares two elements of the array and returns a negative number if the first element is smaller, a positive number if the first element is larger, and zero if they are equal. In this case, the function `(a,b) => a-b` subtracts the second element from the first element, which sorts the array in ascending order.\n\nThe second line of the function checks if the length of the sorted list is less than 2. If it is, the function returns null. If it is not, the function returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest number in the original list.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (next_smallest lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_87_get_row", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (get_row lst x)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_87_get_row.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate get_row))\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 1 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 1)) 1) (list (list 0 0) (list 1 4) (list 1 0) (list 2 5) (list 2 0)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)) 2) (list (list 0 1) (list 1 1) (list 2 1) (list 3 1) (list 4 1) (list 5 1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) (list 1 1 3 4 5 6) (list 1 2 1 4 5 6) (list 1 2 3 1 5 6) (list 1 2 3 4 1 6) (list 1 2 3 4 5 1)) 1) (list (list 0 0) (list 1 0) (list 2 1) (list 2 0) (list 3 2) (list 3 0) (list 4 3) (list 4 0) (list 5 4) (list 5 0) (list 6 5) (list 6 0)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) 1) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1)) 2) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list ) (list 1) (list 1 2 3)) 3) (list (list 2 2)) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize a new empty string `new_text` to hold the new text.\n2. Initialize a variable `i` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the input string.\n3. Initialize variables `start` and `end` to 0 to keep track of the start and end positions of consecutive spaces.\n4. Loop through the input string using a `while` loop until `i` is equal to the length of the string.\n5. If the current character at position `i` is a space, increment `end` by 1 to keep track of the number of consecutive spaces.\n6. If the current character at position `i` is not a space, then:\n   1. If the number of spaces between `start` and `end` is greater than 2, add a hyphen followed by the current character to `new_text`.\n   2. If the number of spaces between `start` and `end` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 2, add underscores equal to the number of spaces between `start` and `end`, followed by the current character to `new_text`.\n   3. If there are no spaces between `start` and `end`, simply add the current character to `new_text`.\n   4. Set `start` and `end` to `i+1` to start counting spaces again.\n7. Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next character in the input string.\n8. After the loop, check if there are any remaining spaces between `start` and `end` and add underscores or a hyphen as appropriate.\n9.

The function takes an array of numbers as input and returns an array of the same length, where each element is the maximum value of the original array up to that index.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables: `running_max` and `result`. `running_max` is used to keep track of the maximum value seen so far, and `result` is the array that will be returned.\n\nThe function then iterates over each element of the input array using a for-of loop. For each element, it checks if `running_max` is null. If it is, it sets `running_max` to the current element. Otherwise, it uses the `Math.max` function to compare `running_max` with the current element and update `running_max` to the larger of the two.\n\nFinally, the function pushes the current value of `running_max` onto the `result` array and continues to the next element of the input array.

The function returns a string of words from the input sentence that are not divisible by any number other than 1 and themselves. \n\n1. `let new_lst = [];` creates an empty list called `new_lst` that will be used to store the words that meet the criteria.\n2. `for(let word of sentence.split(\" \")){` splits the input sentence into words using the space character as a delimiter and loops over each word.\n3. `let flg = 0;` creates a variable called `flg` and sets it to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of whether or not a word meets the criteria.\n4. `if(word.length == 1){` checks if the length of the current word is 1. If it is, then the word is automatically added to the `new_lst` list because it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n5. `flg = 1;` sets the `flg` variable to 1 if the length of the current word is 1. This is done to ensure that the word is added to the `new_lst` list.\n6. `for(let i=2; i<word.length; i++){` loops over each number from 2 to the length of the current word minus 1.\n7. `if(word.length%i == 0){` checks if the length of the current word is divisible by the current number in the loop.

It subtracts the corresponding element in `guess` from `x` and takes the absolute value of the result. \n\n    c. `Math.abs` - This is a built-in JavaScript function that returns the absolute value of a number. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (compare game guess)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_26_remove_duplicates", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (remove_duplicates numbers)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_26_remove_duplicates.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate remove_duplicates))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4)) (list 1 2 3 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 2 4 3 5)) (list 1 4 5) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new array that contains only the unique numbers from the original array. \n\nThe function works by creating an object called `c` that will be used to count the number of times each number appears in the input array. The `forEach` method is used to loop through each number in the input array. For each number, the code checks if it already exists as a key in the `c` object. If it does, the value associated with that key is incremented by 1. If it doesn't, a new key is created with a value of 1. \n\nAfter the `forEach` loop is finished, the `filter` method is used to create a new array that contains only the numbers from the input array that appear once (i.e., have a count of 1 in the `c` object). The `filter` method works by looping through each number in the input array and only including it in the new array if the count associated with that number in the `c` object is less than or equal to 1. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (remove_duplicates numbers)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_nested_parens paren_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate parse_nested_parens))\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\") (list 2 3 1 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"() (()) ((())) (((())))\") (list 1 2 3 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()(())((())))\") (list 4) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function works by first defining an inner function `parse_paren_group` that takes a string of parentheses and returns the maximum depth of nested parentheses in that string. The outer function then splits the input string into groups of parentheses, filters out any empty strings, and maps the `parse_paren_group` function over each group to get the maximum depth of nested parentheses.\n\nThe `parse_paren_group` function works by iterating over each character in the input string and keeping track of the current depth of nested parentheses. Whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered, the depth is incremented and the maximum depth seen so far is updated if necessary. Whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered, the depth is decremented. Finally, the maximum depth seen is returned.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_nested_parens paren_string)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_155_even_odd_count", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (even_odd_count num)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_155_even_odd_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate even_odd_count))\n    (check-within (candidate 7) (list 0 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -78) (list 1 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3452) (list 2 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 346211) (list 3 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -345821) (list 3 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -2) (list 1 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -45347) (list 2 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 0) (list 1 0) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The XOR operation is performed on each character of the two strings, and the result is a string of the same length as the input strings.\n\nThe function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function, `string_xor`, and the parameters, `a` and `b`, in parentheses. The function body is enclosed in curly braces.\n\nThe first line of the function body declares a variable `result` and initializes it to an empty string. This variable will be used to accumulate the result of the XOR operation.\n\nThe next line of the function body starts a `for` loop that iterates over the indices of the characters in the string `a`. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop condition is `i<a.length`, which means that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `a`. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.\n\nInside the loop, the result of the XOR operation on the `i`-th characters of `a` and `b` is computed using the ternary operator `? :`. If the `i`-th characters of `a` and `b` are equal, the result is `'0'`, otherwise it is `'1'`. The resulting character is appended to the `result` string using the `+=` operator.\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the `result` string is returned as the result of the function.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (string_xor a b)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_23_strlen", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (strlen string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_23_strlen.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate strlen))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"x\") 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"asdasnakj\") 9 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The resulting array is stored in a variable called `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the function returns `'No'` because a valid file name should have exactly one `.` character.\n\nNext, the function checks if the second part of `lst` (i.e., the file extension) is in the `suf` array.

The function checks whether the input array can be arranged in non-decreasing order by swapping at most one pair of elements. If the array can be arranged in non-decreasing order, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the element that needs to be swapped to arrange the array in non-decreasing order.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables `ind` and `i` to -1 and 1, respectively. The variable `ind` is used to keep track of the index of the element that needs to be swapped, while `i` is used to iterate over the array.\n\nThe function then enters a while loop that continues until `i` is equal to the length of the input array. Inside the loop, the function checks whether the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, the function sets `ind` to the current index `i`. This means that the current element needs to be swapped with the previous element to arrange the array in non-decreasing order.\n\nFinally, the function returns `ind`.

The function returns the sum of all even elements at odd indices of the input list. \n\nThe function first filters the input list to only include elements that are even and at odd indices. This is done using the `filter` method of the `lst` object. The `filter` method takes a function as input that returns a boolean value. If the function returns `true`, the element is included in the filtered list. If it returns `false`, the element is excluded. In this case, the function is defined using an arrow function that takes two arguments: `x` and `i`. `x` is the current element being processed, and `i` is its index in the list. The function returns `true` if `i` is odd and `x` is even, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe filtered list is then passed to the `reduce` method of the `lst` object. The `reduce` method takes a function as input that combines all elements of the list into a single value. In this case, the function is defined using an arrow function that takes two arguments: `a` and `b`. `a` is the accumulated value so far, and `b` is the current element being processed. The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`. The `reduce` method starts with an initial value of `0`, and applies the function to each element of the filtered list in turn. The final result is the sum of all even elements at odd indices of the input list.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (add lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_5_intersperse", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (intersperse numbers delimeter)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_5_intersperse.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate intersperse))\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) 7) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 6 3 2) 8) (list 5 8 6 8 3 8 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 2 2) 2) (list 2 2 2 2 2) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function works by iterating over the string and keeping track of the number of open and closed parentheses encountered so far. If at any point the number of closed parentheses encountered is greater than the number of open parentheses, the function returns false. If the iteration completes and the number of open and closed parentheses is equal, the function returns true.\n\nThe function then concatenates the two input strings in two different orders and stores them in variables `S1` and `S2`.\n\nFinally, the function returns 'Yes' if either `S1` or `S2` has balanced parentheses, and 'No' otherwise. This is done using the ternary operator, which is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. If the condition before the ? is true, the expression before the : is returned, otherwise the expression after the : is returned. In this case, if either `check(S1)` or `check(S2)` is true, the function returns 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (match_parens lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (filter_by_substring strings substring)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate filter_by_substring))\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) \"john\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"xxx\" \"asd\" \"xxy\" \"john doe\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") \"xxx\") (list \"xxx\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"xxx\" \"asd\" \"aaaxxy\" \"john doe\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") \"xx\") (list \"xxx\" \"aaaxxy\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"grunt\" \"trumpet\" \"prune\" \"gruesome\") \"run\") (list \"grunt\" \"prune\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new array that contains all the elements of the `strings` array that include the `substring`.\n\nThe `filter` method is used to create a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that pass a certain test.

The callback function is defined using an arrow function expression, which is a shorthand way of defining a function.\n\nThe `includes` method is used to check whether the `substring` is present in the element.

If it is not, the `includes` method returns `false`, and the element is not included in the new array.\n\nThe `filter_by_substring` function returns the new array that contains only the elements of the `strings` array that include the `substring`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (filter_by_substring strings substring)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_158_find_max", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (find_max words)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_158_find_max.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate find_max))\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"name\" \"of\" \"string\")) \"string\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"name\" \"enam\" \"game\")) \"enam\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"aaaaaaa\" \"bb\" \"cc\")) \"aaaaaaa\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"abc\" \"cba\")) \"abc\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"play\" \"this\" \"game\" \"of\" \"footbott\")) \"footbott\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"we\" \"are\" \"gonna\" \"rock\")) \"gonna\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"we\" \"are\" \"a\" \"mad\" \"nation\")) \"nation\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"this\" \"is\" \"a\" \"prrk\")) \"this\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"b\")) \"b\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"play\" \"play\" \"play\")) \"play\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the string with the largest number of unique characters. If there are multiple strings with the same number of unique characters, the function returns the string that comes first in lexicographic order.\n\nThe function works by first sorting the array of strings in descending order of the number of unique characters in each string. It does this by calling the `sort` method on the `words` array and passing in a comparison function as an argument. The comparison function takes two strings, `a` and `b`, and returns a negative number if `a` should come before `b`, a positive number if `b` should come before `a`, and zero if they are equal.\n\nThe comparison function calculates the number of unique characters in each string by creating a new `Set` object for each string and getting the size of the set. It then subtracts the size of the set for `a` from the size of the set for `b`. If the result is non-zero, it returns the result. Otherwise, it uses the `localeCompare` method to compare the two strings lexicographically and returns the result of that comparison.\n\nFinally, the function returns the first element of the sorted array, which will be the string with the largest number of unique characters.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (find_max words)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_163_generate_integers", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (generate_integers a b)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_163_generate_integers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate generate_integers))\n    (check-within (candidate 2 10) (list 2 4 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 2) (list 2 4 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 132 2) (list 2 4 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 17 89) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an array of even integers between `a` and `b` inclusive. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function swaps the values of `a` and `b`.\n\nThe first line of the function declares the function name and its arguments. \n\n```javascript\nfunction generate_integers(a, b){\n```\n\nThe second line of the function declares a variable `lower` and assigns it the value of the maximum of 2 and the minimum of `a` and `b`. \n\n```javascript\n  let lower = Math.max(2, Math.min(a, b));\n```\n\nThe third line of the function declares a variable `upper` and assigns it the value of the minimum of 8 and the maximum of `a` and `b`. \n\n```javascript\n  let upper = Math.min(8, Math.max(a, b));\n```\n\nThe fourth line of the function returns an array of length `upper-lower+1` using the `Array.from` method. The `Array.from` method creates a new array from an iterable object. In this case, the iterable object is an object with a `length` property of `upper-lower+1`. The second argument of the `Array.from` method is a mapping function that maps each element of the new array to a value. In this case, the mapping function is a lambda function that takes two arguments, `_` and `i`, and returns `i+lower`. The `_` argument is a placeholder for the index of the element, which is not used in the mapping function. The `i` argument is the value of the index of the element, which is used to calculate the value of the element. \n\n```javascript\n  return Array.from({length: upper-lower+1}, (_, i) => i+lower)\n```\n\nThe fifth line of the function filters the array returned by the `Array.from` method to include only even integers.

It takes an integer as an argument and returns the Roman numeral representation of that integer.\n\nThe function starts by defining two arrays: `num` and `sym`. `num` contains the integer values of the Roman numerals, and `sym` contains the corresponding symbols. For example, `num[0]` is 1, and `sym[0]` is \"I\".\n\nThe function then initializes two variables: `i` and `res`. `i` is set to 12, which is the index of the largest Roman numeral in the `num` array (1000). `res` is an empty string that will be used to build the Roman numeral representation of the input integer.\n\nThe function then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `number` is truthy (i.e. not 0). Inside the loop, the function calculates the number of times the current Roman numeral can be subtracted from `number` using integer division (`Math.floor(number / num[i])`). It then subtracts that value from `number` using the modulus operator (`number %= num[i]`). Finally, it adds the corresponding symbol to `res` that many times using another `while` loop.\n\nAfter the inner `while` loop completes, `i` is decremented to move on to the next smaller Roman numeral. The outer `while` loop continues until `number` is 0.\n\nFinally, the function returns `res` in lowercase.

The function returns a new string that is the same as the input string except that all the letters in the string are swapped to their opposite case. For example, if the input string is \"Hello World\", the output string will be \"hELLO wORLD\". If the input string contains no letters, the output string will be the reverse of the input string.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables, `flg` and `idx`, to 0. It also creates a new array called `new_str` that is a copy of the input string split into individual characters.\n\nThe function then loops through each character in the input string using a `for...of` loop. For each character, it checks if it is a letter using a regular expression that matches any letter (case-insensitive). If the character is a letter, it swaps its case by checking if it is uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method. If it is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method, and vice versa. It also sets the `flg` variable to 1 to indicate that at least one letter has been swapped.\n\nAfter processing all the characters in the input string, the function checks if any letters were swapped by checking the value of the `flg` variable. If no letters were swapped, it returns the reverse of the input string using the `reverse()` method and then joining the characters back together using the `join()` method.\n\nIf at least one letter was swapped, the function returns the modified `new_str` array joined back together into a string using the `join()` method. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (solve s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_157_right_angle_triangle", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (right_angle_triangle a b c)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_157_right_angle_triangle.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate right_angle_triangle))\n    (check-within (candidate 3 4 5) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2 3) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 6 8) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 2) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 24 25) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 5 7) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5 12 13) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 15 8 17) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 48 55 73) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 1 1) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 10) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes in three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the length of the sides of the triangle. The function returns a boolean value, `true` if the triangle is a right angle triangle and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function checks if the square of one side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is done for all three sides of the triangle. If any of the sides satisfy this condition, then the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses the `==` operator to check if the square of one side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

The function filters the list to only include positive odd integers that do not contain a decimal point. It then squares each of the filtered integers and returns the sum of the squares multiplied by 2.\n\nThe first line of the function defines the function name and its argument, `lst`. \n\nThe second line filters the list `lst` using the `filter()` method. The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test function is an arrow function that checks if the element is greater than 0, is odd, and does not contain a decimal point. The `!/\\./.test(i)` part checks if the element does not contain a decimal point. \n\nThe third line uses the `reduce()` method to sum the squares of the filtered elements. The `reduce()` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. In this case, the function is an arrow function that adds the square of the current element to the accumulator. The `0` at the end is the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the squares multiplied by 2. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (double_the_difference lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_137_compare_one", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (compare_one a b)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_137_compare_one.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate compare_one))\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2) 2 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2.5) 2.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 3) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5 6) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 \"2,3\") \"2,3\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"5,1\" \"6\") \"6\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"1\" \"2\") \"2\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"1\" 1) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. The algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and setting `a` to `b` and `b` to the remainder. This is done until `b` is zero, at which point `a` is the greatest common divisor.\n\nThe function starts by defining a `while` loop that will run as long as `b` is truthy (i.e. not zero). Inside the loop, the code uses destructuring assignment to swap the values of `a` and `b`, and set `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. This is done using the modulo operator (`%`). \n\nFinally, when the loop is finished, the function returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b` values.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (greatest_common_divisor a b)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_106_f", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (f n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_106_f.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate f))\n    (check-within (candidate 5) (list 1 2 6 24 15) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7) (list 1 2 6 24 15 720 28) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) (list 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3) (list 1 2 6) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is monotonic or not. A list is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. \n\nThe function uses the `every` method of the `Array` object twice. The `every` method returns `true` if every element in the array satisfies the condition specified by the callback function. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe first `every` method checks if the list is non-decreasing. It does this by checking if every element in the list is greater than or equal to the previous element. The callback function passed to the `every` method takes two arguments: the current element `x` and its index `i`. If the index is 0, the function returns `true` because the first element has no previous element to compare to. Otherwise, the function returns `true` if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element.\n\nThe second `every` method checks if the list is non-increasing. It does this by checking if every element in the list is less than or equal to the previous element. The callback function passed to the `every` method is similar to the one used in the first `every` method, but it checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element.\n\nThe `||` operator combines the two `every` method calls using logical OR. If either of the `every` method calls returns `true`, the entire expression evaluates to `true`. Otherwise, it evaluates to `false`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (monotonic l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_105_by_length", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (by_length arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_105_by_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate by_length))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 1 1 4 5 8 2 3)) (list \"Eight\" \"Five\" \"Four\" \"Three\" \"Two\" \"Two\" \"One\" \"One\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 -1 55)) (list \"One\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 -1 3 2)) (list \"Three\" \"Two\" \"One\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 9 4 8)) (list \"Nine\" \"Eight\" \"Four\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The strings in the new array are the English words for the integers in the input array, sorted in descending order of the length of the strings.\n\nThe function starts by defining an object called `dic` that maps integers to their English word equivalents. The object is defined using the curly brace syntax, with each key-value pair separated by a colon. The keys are integers, and the values are strings.\n\nThe function then sorts the input array in descending order using the `sort` method. The `sort` method takes a comparison function as an argument, which is used to determine the order of the elements in the sorted array. In this case, the comparison function is an arrow function that subtracts `b` from `a`, resulting in a descending order.\n\nThe function then creates a new empty array called `new_arr`. It then iterates over the sorted input array using a `for...of` loop. The loop variable is called `var_`, and it takes on the value of each element in the sorted array in turn.\n\nFor each element in the sorted array, the function checks if the `dic` object has a key that matches the value of the element. If it does, the function pushes the corresponding value (the English word) onto the `new_arr` array.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `new_arr` array.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (by_length arr)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_134_check_if_last_char_is_a_letter", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (check_if_last_char_is_a_letter txt)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_134_check_if_last_char_is_a_letter.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate check_if_last_char_is_a_letter))\n    (check-within (candidate \"apple\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"apple pi e\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"eeeee\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"A\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Pumpkin pie \") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Pumpkin pie 1\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"eeeee e \") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"apple pie\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"apple pi e \") #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `split` method is used to split the string into an array of words, and the `pop` method is used to get the last word in the array.\n\n```return check.length == 1 && check.toLowerCase().charCodeAt(0) >= 97 && check.toLowerCase().charCodeAt(0) <= 122;```\n\nThis line returns a boolean value indicating whether the last character of the last word in the string `txt` is a letter. The `length` property is used to check if the last word has only one character. The `toLowerCase` method is used to convert the character to lowercase, and the `charCodeAt` method is used to get the Unicode value of the character.

The function checks if the input number is 1 or 0, and returns false if it is. If the input number is 2, the function returns true. Otherwise, the function checks if the input number is divisible by any number between 2 and the input number - 1, and returns false if it is. If the function has not returned false at this point, it returns true.\n\nThe `intersection` function then initializes two variables `l` and `r` to the maximum of the first element of the first interval and the first element of the second interval, and the minimum of the second element of the first interval and the second element of the second interval, respectively. These variables represent the left and right endpoints of the intersection between the two intervals.\n\nThe function then calculates the length of the intersection by subtracting `l` from `r`, and stores the result in a variable called `length`.\n\nIf the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and is a prime number (as determined by the `is_prime` function), the function returns \"YES\".

The first line defines the function `is_bored` with a single parameter `S`.\n2. The second line declares a variable `sentences` and assigns it the result of calling the `split` method on `S`. The `split` method takes a regular expression as an argument and splits the string into an array of substrings where the regular expression matches. In this case, the regular expression matches any period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters. This effectively splits the string into an array of sentences.\n3. The third line returns the length of the array of sentences that start with the word \"I\". This is accomplished using the `filter` method on the `sentences` array. The `filter` method takes a function as an argument and returns a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the function returns `true`. In this case, the function is an arrow function that takes a single parameter `sentence` and returns `true` if the first two characters of `sentence` are \"I \" (i.e. \"I \" followed by a space).

The loop starts at 0 and ends at `string.length-substring.length+1`.

The `search` function takes a list `lst` as input.\n2. The first line of the function creates an array `frq` of size `Math.max(...lst)+1` and fills it with 0s. This array will be used to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list.\n3. The second line of the function uses the `forEach` method to iterate over each element `i` in the input list `lst`. For each element, the corresponding index in the `frq` array is incremented by 1.\n4. The third line of the function initializes a variable `ans` to -1. This variable will be used to store the answer.\n5. The fourth line of the function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each index `i` in the `frq` array, starting from 1. \n6. For each index `i`, the `if` statement checks if the frequency of the integer at that index is greater than or equal to the index itself. If so, the `ans` variable is updated to the current index `i`.\n7. Finally, the function returns the `ans` variable, which contains the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to its frequency in the input list. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (search lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_68_pluck", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (pluck arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_68_pluck.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate pluck))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 4 2 3)) (list 2 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3)) (list 2 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 0 3 0 4 2)) (list 0 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 0 5 3)) (list 0 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 4 8 4 8)) (list 4 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 7 6 7 1)) (list 6 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 7 9 7 1)) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If it is, the function returns an empty array.\n3. `evens = arr.filter(x => x%2 == 0)`: This line creates a new array called `evens` that contains only the even numbers from the input array. It does this by using the `filter` method to iterate over each element of the input array and only keep the elements that satisfy the condition `x%2 == 0`.\n4. `if(evens.length == 0) return []`: This line checks if the `evens` array is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty array.\n5. `return [Math.min(...evens), arr.indexOf(Math.min(...evens))]`: This line returns an array containing two elements.

The function starts by defining a loop that iterates over the list of numbers. The loop is defined using the `for` keyword and has three parts: an initialization expression (`let i=0`), a condition (`i<l.length`), and an update expression (`i++`). These parts are separated by semicolons. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `l`. The update expression increments `i` by 1 after each iteration of the loop.\n\n2. Inside the first loop, there is another loop that iterates over the remaining elements of the list. This loop is also defined using the `for` keyword, but with a different initialization expression (`let j=i+1`). This ensures that the second loop only considers elements that come after the current element of the first loop. The condition and update expressions are the same as in the first loop.\n\n3. Inside the second loop, there is an `if` statement that checks whether the sum of the current element and the element being considered in the second loop is equal to zero. If this is the case, the function returns `true`, indicating that a pair of elements that sum up to zero has been found.\n\n4. If the loops complete without finding a pair of elements that sum up to zero, the function returns `false`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (pairs_sum_to_zero l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_10_make_palindrome", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (make_palindrome string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_10_make_palindrome.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate make_palindrome))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"x\") \"x\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"xyz\") \"xyzyx\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"xyx\") \"xyx\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"jerry\") \"jerryrrej\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.\n\nThe function takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value. It returns true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the characters of the string. The loop starts at the first character (i=0) and continues until the last character (i<text.length). The loop increments the value of i by 1 in each iteration.\n\nInside the loop, the function checks if the i-th character of the string is equal to the (text.length-1-i)-th character of the string. If they are not equal, the function returns false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.\n\nIf the loop completes without returning false, the function returns true, indicating that the string is a palindrome.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (is_palindrome text)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_108_count_nums", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (count_nums arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_108_count_nums.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate count_nums))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -2 0)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 1 2 -2 3 4 5)) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 6 9 -6 0 1 5)) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 100 98 -7 1 -1)) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 12 23 34 -45 -56 0)) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 1)) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1)) 1 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `count_nums` takes an array `arr` as input.\n2. The function `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the digits of `n`.\n3. The variable `neg` is initialized to 1.\n4. If `n` is negative, `n` is multiplied by -1 and `neg` is set to -1.\n5. `n` is converted to an array of digits using `Array.from(String(n), Number)`.\n6. The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`.\n7. The sum of the digits of `n` is computed using `n.reduce((a,b) => a+b, 0)`.\n8. The `digits_sum` function returns the sum of the digits of `n`.\n9. The `count_nums` function maps the `digits_sum` function over the array `arr` using `arr.map(digits_sum)`.\n10. The `filter` method is used to remove all elements of the resulting array that are less than or equal to 0 using `.filter(x => x > 0)`.\n11.

The function returns the number of triples of numbers in the range 1 to n (inclusive) such that the sum of the squares of the three numbers is divisible by 3.\n\nThe function starts by creating an array `A` of length `n` using the `Array.from` method. The `Array.from` method creates a new array with the specified length and fills it with values returned by the provided function. In this case, the function returns the value `(i+1)*(i+1)-i` for each index `i` in the array. This formula calculates the square of the number `i+1` minus `i`, which is equivalent to `i*i + i + 1`.\n\nThe function then initializes an empty array `ans` to store the triples that satisfy the condition. It then uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible triples of indices in the range `0` to `n-1`. For each triple `(i,j,k)`, it checks if the sum of the squares of the corresponding values in `A` is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the triple to the `ans` array.\n\nFinally, the function returns the length of the `ans` array, which is the number of triples that satisfy the condition.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (get_max_triples n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_86_anti_shuffle", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (anti_shuffle s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_86_anti_shuffle.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate anti_shuffle))\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hi\") \"Hi\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"hello\") \"ehllo\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"number\") \"bemnru\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcd\") \"abcd\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hello World!!!\") \"Hello !!!Wdlor\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hi.

The `split` method splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, the separator is a space character `' '`. \n\nThe `map` method is then called on the array of words. The `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the provided function is an arrow function that takes a word `i` as input. \n\nThe arrow function converts the word `i` into an array of characters using the spread operator `...`. The spread operator allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. \n\nThe `sort` method is then called on the array of characters. The `sort` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. In this case, the `sort` method sorts the characters of the word `i` in alphabetical order. \n\nThe `join` method is then called on the sorted array of characters. The `join` method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by a specified separator string. In this case, the separator string is an empty string `''`. \n\nThe arrow function returns the sorted and joined word `i`. \n\nThe `join` method is then called on the array of sorted and joined words. The `join` method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by a specified separator string. In this case, the separator string is a space character `' '`. \n\nThe `anti_shuffle` function returns the sorted and joined string of words. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (anti_shuffle s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_84_solve", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (solve N)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_84_solve.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate solve))\n    (check-within (candidate 1000) \"1\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 150) \"110\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 147) \"1100\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 333) \"1001\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 963) \"10010\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The problem is to find the minimum path from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner of the grid. The grid is represented by a two-dimensional array of integers. The value of each element in the array represents the cost of moving from that element to the next element. The cost of moving from one element to another is the absolute difference between the values of the two elements.\n\nThe function `minPath` takes two arguments: `grid` and `k`. `grid` is the two-dimensional array representing the grid, and `k` is the number of steps in the path. The function returns an array of integers representing the minimum path.\n\nThe function first initializes two variables: `n` and `val`. `n` is the length of the grid, and `val` is initialized to `n * n + 1`. `val` is used to keep track of the minimum cost of moving from one element to another.\n\nThe function then loops through each element in the grid using two nested `for` loops. For each element, the function checks if the value of the element is `1`. If the value of the element is `1`, the function checks the values of the adjacent elements to the current element. If an adjacent element has a value less than `val`, `val` is updated to the value of the adjacent element.\n\nAfter the loop, the function initializes an empty array `ans`. The function then loops `k` times and adds either `1` or `val` to the `ans` array depending on the index of the loop.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `ans` array.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (minPath grid k)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_89_encrypt", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (encrypt s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_89_encrypt.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate encrypt))\n    (check-within (candidate \"hi\") \"lm\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"asdfghjkl\") \"ewhjklnop\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"gf\") \"kj\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"et\") \"ix\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"faewfawefaewg\") \"jeiajeaijeiak\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"hellomyfriend\") \"lippsqcjvmirh\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh\") \"hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a\") \"e\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted string. \n\nThe encryption algorithm works as follows:\n1. Define a string `d` that contains all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n2. Create an empty string `out` that will be used to store the encrypted string.\n3. Iterate over each character `c` in the input string `s`.\n4. If the character `c` is a lowercase letter, find its index in the string `d` using the `indexOf` method.\n5. Add `2*2` to the index of the character `c` and take the result modulo `26` to get the index of the encrypted character in the string `d`.\n6. Append the encrypted character to the string `out`.\n7. If the character `c` is not a lowercase letter, append it to the string `out` as is.\n8. Return the encrypted string `out`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (encrypt s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_100_make_a_pile", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (make_a_pile n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_100_make_a_pile.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate make_a_pile))\n    (check-within (candidate 3) (list 3 5 7) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) (list 4 6 8 10) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) (list 5 7 9 11 13) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) (list 6 8 10 12 14 16) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) (list 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The loop variable is `k`. \n\nFor each value of `k`, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `k`. If `n` is divisible by `k`, then `n` is not prime and the function returns `false`.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding a value of `k` that divides `n`, then `n` is prime and the function returns `true`.\n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (is_prime n)\n"}]
