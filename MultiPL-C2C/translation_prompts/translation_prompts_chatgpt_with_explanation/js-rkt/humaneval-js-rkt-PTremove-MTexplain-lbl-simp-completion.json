This variable will be used to keep track of the depth of the bracketing. \n\n2. `for(let b of brackets){` starts a loop that iterates over each character in the `brackets` string. \n\n3. `if(b === '('){` checks if the current character is an opening bracket. If it is, then `depth` is incremented by 1. \n\n4. `depth -= 1;` is executed if the current character is a closing bracket. This decrements the `depth` variable by 1. \n\n5. `if(depth < 0){` checks if the `depth` variable is less than 0. If it is, then the bracketing is not balanced and the function returns false. \n\n6. `return depth == 0;` is executed after the loop has finished iterating over all the characters in the `brackets` string. If the `depth` variable is equal to 0, then the bracketing is balanced and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. \n\nIn summary, the function checks if the number of opening brackets in the `brackets` string is equal to the number of closing brackets and if they are in the correct order. If they are, then the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (correct_bracketing brackets)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_45_triangle_area", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (triangle_area a h)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_45_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate triangle_area))\n    (check-within (candidate 5 3) 7.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2) 2.0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 8) 40.0 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `fib4` takes in a number `n` and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\n1. `let results = [0, 0, 2, 0];` - This line initializes an array called `results` with four elements: 0, 0, 2, and 0. This is because the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... and the function is designed to return the fourth number in the sequence if `n` is less than 4.\n\n2. `if (n < 4){ return results[n]; }` - This line checks if `n` is less than 4. If it is, then the function returns the `n`th element of the `results` array.\n\n3. `for (let i = 4; i <= n; i++){` - This line starts a for loop that iterates from 4 to `n`.\n\n4. `let sum = results[0] + results[1] + results[2] + results[3];` - This line calculates the sum of the last four elements in the `results` array.\n\n5. `results.shift();` - This line removes the first element of the `results` array.\n\n6. `results.push(sum);` - This line adds the `sum` variable to the end of the `results` array.\n\n7. `return results[3];` - This line returns the fourth element of the `results` array, which is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nIn summary, the function initializes an array with the first four elements of the Fibonacci sequence, and then iteratively calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the last four elements of the array and shifting the array to remove the first element and add the sum to the end. If `n` is less than 4, the function returns the `n`th element of the `results` array. Otherwise, it returns the fourth element of the `results` array, which is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (fib4 n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_145_order_by_points", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (order_by_points nums)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_145_order_by_points.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate order_by_points))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 11 -1 -11 -12)) (list -1 -11 1 -12 11) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1234 423 463 145 2 423 423 53 6 37 3457 3 56 0 46)) (list 0 2 3 6 53 423 423 423 1234 145 37 46 56 463 3457) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 -11 -32 43 54 -98 2 -3)) (list -3 -32 -98 -11 1 2 43 54) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11)) (list 1 10 2 11 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 6 6 -76 -21 23 4)) (list -76 -21 0 4 23 6 6) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If it is, it sets `n` to its absolute value and sets `neg` to `-1`.\n\n5. `n = Array.from(String(n), Number);`: This line converts the integer `n` to a string, splits the string into an array of characters, and then converts each character back to an integer. The resulting array is assigned to `n`.\n\n6. `n[0] = n[0] * neg;`: This line multiplies the first element of `n` by `neg` to restore the sign of the original integer.\n\n7. `return n.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);`: This line returns the sum of the elements in `n`.\n\n8. `return nums.sort((a, b) => digits_sum(a) - digits_sum(b));`: This line returns a sorted version of `nums` based on the result of calling `digits_sum` on each element. The `sort` method sorts the array in ascending order by default, so subtracting `digits_sum(b)` from `digits_sum(a)` ensures that the array is sorted in descending order of digit sum.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (order_by_points nums)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_80_is_happy", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_happy s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_80_is_happy.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_happy))\n    (check-within (candidate \"a\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"aa\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcd\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"aabb\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"adb\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"xyy\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"iopaxpoi\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"iopaxioi\") #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns `true` if the input string `s` is happy, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if the length of the input string `s` is less than 3. If it is, the function immediately returns `false`. This is because a happy string must have at least 3 characters.\n\nIf the length of the input string `s` is greater than or equal to 3, the function enters a `for` loop that iterates over the characters of the input string `s`. The loop starts at the first character of the string and continues until the second-to-last character of the string. This is because the function checks for happy substrings of length 3, and there is no substring of length 3 that includes the last character of the string.\n\nWithin the loop, the function checks if the current character `s[i]` is equal to the next character `s[i+1]`, or if the next character `s[i+1]` is equal to the character after that `s[i+2]`, or if the current character `s[i]` is equal to the character after that `s[i+2]`. If any of these conditions are true, the function immediately returns `false`. This is because a happy string must not have any adjacent characters that are the same, or any adjacent pairs of characters that are the same with a character in between them.\n\nIf the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`. This is because the input string `s` is happy if and only if it does not contain any adjacent characters that are the same, or any adjacent pairs of characters that are the same with a character in between them.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (is_happy s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_65_circular_shift", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (circular_shift x shift)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_65_circular_shift.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate circular_shift))\n    (check-within (candidate 100 2) \"001\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12 2) \"12\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 97 8) \"79\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12 1) \"21\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11 101) \"11\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a string that is the result of circularly shifting the digits of the input string `x` by `shift` places. \n\n1. `let s = String(x);` - This line creates a new variable `s` and assigns it the value of `x` converted to a string. This is done to ensure that the input is a string and not a number.\n\n2. `if(shift > s.length){` - This line checks if the value of `shift` is greater than the length of the string `s`. If it is, then the function returns the reverse of the string `s`. \n\n3. `return s.split(\"\").reverse().join(\"\");` - This line splits the string `s` into an array of characters, reverses the order of the elements in the array, and then joins the elements back into a string. The resulting string is then returned.\n\n4. `return s.slice(s.length-shift) + s.slice(0, s.length-shift);` - This line returns a new string that is the result of circularly shifting the characters in the string `s` by `shift` places. The first part of the line `s.slice(s.length-shift)` returns a substring of `s` that starts at the index `s.length-shift` and goes to the end of the string. The second part of the line `s.slice(0, s.length-shift)` returns a substring of `s` that starts at the beginning of the string and goes up to, but not including, the index `s.length-shift`. These two substrings are then concatenated together to form the final result. \n\nIn summary, the function `circular_shift` takes an input string `x` and an integer `shift`, and returns a new string that is the result of circularly shifting the characters in `x` by `shift` places. If `shift` is greater than the length of `x`, then the function returns the reverse of `x`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (circular_shift x shift)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_115_max_fill", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (max_fill grid capacity)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_115_max_fill.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate max_fill))\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 0 0 1 0) (list 0 1 0 0) (list 1 1 1 1)) 1) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 0 0 1 1) (list 0 0 0 0) (list 1 1 1 1) (list 0 1 1 1)) 2) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0)) 5) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 1 1 1) (list 1 1 1 1)) 2) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 1 1 1) (list 1 1 1 1)) 9) 2 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `grid` argument is a two-dimensional array of numbers, and the `capacity` argument is a number. The function returns the maximum number of times that the `capacity` can be filled in the `grid`.\n\nThe `reduce` method is used to iterate through the `grid` array. The `reduce` method takes in a callback function that is executed on each element of the array. The callback function takes in two arguments, `acc` and `arr`. The `acc` argument is the accumulator that stores the result of the previous iteration, and the `arr` argument is the current element of the array. \n\nThe callback function uses another `reduce` method to iterate through the `arr` array. The `reduce` method takes in another callback function that is executed on each element of the array. The callback function takes in two arguments, `a` and `b`. The `a` argument is the accumulator that stores the result of the previous iteration, and the `b` argument is the current element of the array. \n\nThe callback function adds `a` and `b` together and returns the result. The `reduce` method returns the sum of all the elements in the `arr` array.\n\nThe `Math.ceil` method is used to round up the result of the `reduce` method to the nearest integer. This is because the `capacity` argument is the maximum amount that can be filled, and any amount over the `capacity` is considered a new fill.\n\nThe callback function of the outer `reduce` method adds the result of the inner `reduce` method to the accumulator `acc`. The `reduce` method returns the sum of all the fills in the `grid` array. \n\nThe `0` argument of the outer `reduce` method is the initial value of the accumulator. It is set to `0` because there are no fills in the `grid` array yet. \n\nIn summary, the `max_fill` function calculates the maximum number of times that the `capacity` can be filled in the `grid` array by iterating through the `grid` array and calculating the number of fills in each element of the array. The function returns the sum of all the fills in the `grid` array. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (max_fill grid capacity)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_0_has_close_elements", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (has_close_elements numbers threshold)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_0_has_close_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate has_close_elements))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2) 0.3) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2) 0.05) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0) 0.95) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0) 0.8) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0) 0.1) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1) 1.0) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1) 0.5) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the count of numbers in the array that are greater than 10 and have an odd first and last digit. \n\n1. `let count = 0;` initializes a variable called `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the count of numbers that meet the criteria.\n2. `for(let num of nums){` starts a loop that iterates over each element of the input array `nums`. The current element is assigned to the variable `num` in each iteration.\n3. `if(num > 10){` checks if the current element `num` is greater than 10.\n4. `let odd_digits = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];` initializes an array called `odd_digits` with odd digits from 1 to 9.\n5. `let number_as_string = String(num);` converts the current element `num` to a string and assigns it to the variable `number_as_string`.\n6. `if(odd_digits.includes(Number(number_as_string[0])) && odd_digits.includes(Number(number_as_string[number_as_string.length-1]))){` checks if the first and last digits of the string representation of the current element `num` are odd digits. If both digits are odd, the count variable `count` is incremented by 1.\n7. `return count;` returns the final value of the `count` variable after the loop has finished iterating over all elements of the input array `nums`. \n\nThe function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers as input, iterates over each element of the array, checks if the element is greater than 10, and if so, checks if the first and last digits of the element are odd digits. If both digits are odd, the count variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the count of numbers that meet the criteria. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (specialFilter nums)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_17_parse_music", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_music music_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_17_parse_music.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate parse_music))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"o o o o\") (list 4 4 4 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \".| .| .| .|\") (list 1 1 1 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"o| o| .| .| o o o o\") (list 2 2 1 1 4 4 4 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"o| .| o| .| o o| o o|\") (list 2 1 2 1 4 2 4 2) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new list that contains only the unique elements of the input list, sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe function works by first creating a new `Set` object from the input list. A `Set` is a built-in JavaScript object that can only contain unique values. The `new` keyword is used to create a new instance of the `Set` object.\n\nThe `...` syntax is used to spread the elements of the `Set` object into a new array. This creates a new array that contains only the unique elements of the input list.\n\nThe `sort` method is then called on the new array, with a callback function that sorts the elements in ascending order. The callback function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which represent two elements being compared. The function returns a negative number if `a` should come before `b`, a positive number if `a` should come after `b`, and 0 if the two elements are equal. In this case, the function simply subtracts `b` from `a`, which sorts the elements in ascending order.\n\nFinally, the sorted array is returned as the result of the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (unique l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_55_fib", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (fib n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_55_fib.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate fib))\n    (check-within (candidate 10) 55 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) 21 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) 89 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12) 144 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on. \n\nThe function `fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nThe first two `if` statements are base cases. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. \n\nThe final line is the recursive case. If `n` is neither 0 nor 1, the function calls itself twice with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the two resulting values. This continues until the base cases are reached. \n\nOverall, the function calculates the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence by recursively summing the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base cases of 0 and 1.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (fib n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_36_fizz_buzz", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (fizz_buzz n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_36_fizz_buzz.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate fizz_buzz))\n    (check-within (candidate 50) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 78) 2 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 79) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 200) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4000) 192 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10000) 639 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100000) 8026 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

These variables will be used to keep track of the closest pair of numbers and the distance between them, respectively.\n\nThe function then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible pairs of numbers in the input array. The outer loop iterates over the array from the first element to the last element, while the inner loop iterates over the array from the first element to the last element. \n\nInside the nested loop, the function checks if the current pair of numbers being considered are not the same number (i.e., `i` is not equal to `j`). If the pair of numbers are not the same, the function calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers using the `Math.abs()` function and stores the result in a variable called `new_distance`.\n\nThe function then checks if the `distance` variable is `null`.

The `map` function is then used to convert each string to a number. The resulting numbers are then assigned to the variables `month`, `day`, and `year`.\n5. `if (month < 1 || month > 12) return false` - checks if the `month` value is less than 1 or greater than 12. If it is, the function returns `false`.\n6. `if ([1,3,5,7,8,10,12].includes(month) && (day < 1 || day > 31)) return false` - checks if the `month` value is one of the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and if the `day` value is less than 1 or greater than 31. If it is, the function returns `false`.\n7. `if ([4,6,9,11].includes(month) && (day < 1 || day > 30)) return false` - checks if the `month` value is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and if the `day` value is less than 1 or greater than 30. If it is, the function returns `false`.\n8. `if (month == 2 && (day < 1 || day > 29)) return false` - checks if the `month` value is February and if the `day` value is less than 1 or greater than 29. If it is, the function returns `false`.\n9. `} catch {` - catches any errors that may have occurred in the try block.\n10. `return false` - returns `false` if an error occurred.\n11. `}` - closes the catch block.\n12. `return true` - returns `true` if the date is valid. \n\nThe function first trims the input string to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. It then splits the string into an array of three strings (month, day, year) using the '-' character as the separator. The `map` function is then used to convert each string to a number. The resulting numbers are then checked to see if they represent a valid date. If the date is valid, the function returns `true`. If the date is not valid or an error occurred, the function returns `false`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in Racket, we could use the `string-split` function to split the input string into an array of three strings. We could then use the `string->number` function to convert each string to a number. We could then use a series of `cond` statements to check if the date is valid. If the date is valid, we would return `#t`. If the date is not valid, we would return `#f`.

The function returns `true` if there are three elements in the array that sum up to zero, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three elements in the array. The outer loop iterates over the first element, the middle loop iterates over the second element, and the inner loop iterates over the third element.\n\nThe `if` statement inside the innermost loop checks whether the sum of the three elements is equal to zero. If it is, the function returns `true`.\n\nIf the function has iterated over all possible combinations of three elements and has not found a sum of zero, it returns `false`. \n\nThe `let` keyword is used to declare variables `i`, `j`, and `k` within the loops. These variables are used to keep track of the current indices being iterated over. The `length` property of the array `l` is used to determine the upper limit of the loops. \n\nThe `===` operator is used to check for strict equality between the sum of the three elements and zero. \n\nOverall, the function checks all possible combinations of three elements in the array to see if any of them sum up to zero.

Otherwise, it returns `false`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (triples_sum_to_zero l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_24_largest_divisor", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (largest_divisor n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_24_largest_divisor.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate largest_divisor))\n    (check-within (candidate 3) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100) 50 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 49) 7 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function starts by creating an object called `value_map` that maps the names of numbers in English to their corresponding numerical values. For example, the string `'one'` maps to the number `1`. This object is used later to compare the numerical values of the numbers in the input string.\n\n2. The input string is split into an array of individual numbers using the `split` method. The separator used is a space character.\n\n3. The resulting array is filtered to remove any empty strings or strings that evaluate to `false`. This is done using the `filter` method with a callback function that returns `true` for non-empty strings and `false` for empty strings.\n\n4. The resulting array of numbers is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method. The `sort` method takes a callback function that compares two elements of the array and returns a negative number if the first element should come before the second element, a positive number if the first element should come after the second element, or zero if the two elements are equal. In this case, the callback function uses the `value_map` object to compare the numerical values of the two elements.\n\n5. The sorted array of numbers is joined back into a string using the `join` method with a space character as the separator.\n\n6.

The function `modp` takes two arguments, `n` and `p`, and returns the result of `2^n` modulo `p`. \n\n1. `function modp(n, p){` - declares a function named `modp` that takes two arguments, `n` and `p`.\n2. `let ret = 1;` - declares a variable `ret` and initializes it to 1. This variable will hold the result of the modular exponentiation.\n3. `for(let i=0; i<n; i++){` - starts a loop that will run `n` times, with `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each time.\n4. `ret = (2 * ret) % p;` - multiplies `ret` by 2 and takes the result modulo `p`, then assigns the result back to `ret`. This is the core of the modular exponentiation algorithm.\n5. `}` - ends the loop.\n6. `return ret;` - returns the final value of `ret`, which is `2^n` modulo `p`. \n\nEssentially, the function is repeatedly squaring 2 `n` times, and taking the result modulo `p` each time.

The function returns the `k` largest elements in the array. \n\n1. `function maximum(arr, k){` - declares a function called `maximum` that takes in two arguments, an array `arr` and a number `k`.\n2. `if(k === 0){` - checks if `k` is equal to 0.\n3. `return [];` - if `k` is equal to 0, returns an empty array.\n4. `arr.sort((a,b) => a-b);` - sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort()` method. The `sort()` method takes in a function that compares two elements of the array and returns a negative number if the first element is less than the second, a positive number if the first element is greater than the second, and 0 if they are equal. In this case, the function `(a,b) => a-b` compares two elements `a` and `b` and returns a negative number if `a` is less than `b`, which sorts the array in ascending order.\n5. `return arr.slice(-k);` - returns the last `k` elements of the sorted array using the `slice()` method. The `slice()` method takes in two arguments, the starting index and the ending index of the slice. In this case, the starting index is `-k`, which means the slice starts from the `k`th element from the end of the array, and the ending index is not specified, which means the slice goes until the end of the array. This returns the last `k` elements of the array, which are the `k` largest elements in the array. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (maximum arr k)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_1_separate_paren_groups", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (separate_paren_groups paren_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_1_separate_paren_groups.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate separate_paren_groups))\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\") (list \"(()())\" \"((()))\" \"()\" \"((())()())\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"() (()) ((())) (((())))\") (list \"()\" \"(())\" \"((()))\" \"(((())))\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()(())((())))\") (list \"(()(())((())))\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\") (list \"()\" \"(())\" \"(()())\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function uses the Node.js built-in module `crypto` to create an MD5 hash of the input string. \n\nThe `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable `crypto` which is assigned the value of the `crypto` module. The `require()` function is used to import the `crypto` module. \n\nThe `return` statement returns the result of the MD5 hash of the input string. The `createHash()` method of the `crypto` module is used to create a hash object with the specified algorithm, in this case `'md5'`. The `update()` method is used to update the hash object with the input string. The `digest()` method is used to return the computed hash in the specified encoding, in this case `'hex'`.\n\nThe ternary operator `?` is used to check if the input string is truthy. If it is, the function returns the MD5 hash of the input string. If it is not, the function returns `null`. \n\nOverall, the function takes in a string and returns its MD5 hash in hexadecimal format, or `null` if the input string is falsy. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (string_to_md5 text)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_41_car_race_collision", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (car_race_collision n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_41_car_race_collision.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate car_race_collision))\n    (check-within (candidate 2) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3) 9 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) 16 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) 64 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) 100 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase using the `toUpperCase` method. \n\nFinally, the mapped array of characters is joined back into a string using the `join` method and returned as the result of the function. \n\nIn summary, the `flip_case` function takes a string and returns a new string with the case of each character flipped.

If this condition is true, then the triangle is not valid and the function returns `-1`. \n\nIf the triangle is valid, then the function continues to calculate the area. \n\nThe next line creates a variable `s` which is equal to half the perimeter of the triangle. \n\nThe next line calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`. \n\nThe area is then rounded to two decimal places using `Math.round(area*100)/100`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the calculated area. \n\nOverall, the function takes three parameters, checks if they form a valid triangle, calculates the area using the formula, rounds the area to two decimal places, and returns the result. \n\nThe function assumes that the input values are valid numbers and does not perform any input validation. It also assumes that the input values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle and does not perform any additional checks to ensure that this is the case. \n\nTo rewrite this program in Racket, you would need to define a function that takes three parameters, performs the same checks, and calculates the area of the triangle using the same formula. You would also need to use Racket's built-in functions for calculating square roots and rounding numbers. Here is an example implementation in Racket:\n\n```\n(define (triangle-area a b c)\n  (if (or (<= (+ a b) c) (<= (+ a c) b) (<= (+ b c) a))\n      -1\n      (let ((s (/ (+ a b c) 2))\n            (area (sqrt (* s (- s a) (- s b) (- s c)))))\n        (round (* area 100) 2))))\n```\n\nThis implementation is similar to the JavaScript version, but uses Racket's `define` syntax to define the function, and Racket's `or` and `let` syntax to perform the checks and calculations. It also uses Racket's `sqrt` and `round` functions to calculate the square root and round the area to two decimal places. \n\nOverall, the Racket implementation performs the same checks and calculations as the JavaScript version, but uses Racket's syntax and built-in functions instead of JavaScript's. \n\nNote that this implementation also assumes that the input values are valid numbers and represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It does not perform any input validation or additional checks. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (triangle_area a b c)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_95_check_dict_case", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (check_dict_case dict)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_95_check_dict_case.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate check_dict_case))\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"p\" .  \"pineapple\") (\"b\" .  \"banana\"))) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"p\" .  \"pineapple\") (\"A\" .  \"banana\") (\"B\" .  \"banana\"))) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"p\" .  \"pineapple\") (\"5\" .  \"banana\") (\"a\" .  \"apple\"))) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"Name\" .  \"John\") (\"Age\" .  \"36\") (\"City\" .  \"Houston\"))) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"STATE\" .  \"NC\") (\"ZIP\" .  \"12345\"))) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"fruit\" .  \"Orange\") (\"taste\" .  \"Sweet\"))) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash()) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The `a-b` part is a comparison function that sorts the elements in ascending order.\n3. `if(l.length % 2 == 1){` - checks if the length of the list is odd. The `%` operator returns the remainder of a division operation. If the length of the list is odd, the remainder of dividing it by 2 will be 1.\n4. `return l[Math.floor(l.length/2)];` - if the length of the list is odd, returns the middle element of the sorted list. The `Math.floor()` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.\n5. `}else{` - if the length of the list is even, executes the following block of code.\n6. `return (l[l.length/2-1] + l[l.length/2])/2;` - returns the average of the two middle elements of the sorted list. The two middle elements are `l[l.length/2-1]` and `l[l.length/2]`. The `/2` part divides the sum of the two middle elements by 2 to get the average. \n\nThe function works by sorting the list of numbers in ascending order, and then checking if the length of the list is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If it's even, it returns the average of the two middle elements of the sorted list. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (median l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_44_change_base", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (change_base x base)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_44_change_base.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate change_base))\n    (check-within (candidate 8 3) \"22\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 9 3) \"100\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 234 2) \"11101010\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 16 2) \"10000\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8 2) \"1000\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 2) \"111\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 3) \"2\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3 4) \"3\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 5) \"4\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5 6) \"5\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6 7) \"6\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 8) \"7\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a string that represents the value of `x` in the new base. \n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable called `ret` to an empty string. \n\nThe function then enters a while loop that will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. \n\nWithin the while loop, the function takes the remainder of `x` when divided by `base` and concatenates it to the beginning of the `ret` string. \n\nThe function then updates the value of `x` to be the result of `x` divided by `base`, rounded down to the nearest integer using the `Math.floor` function. \n\nOnce `x` is no longer greater than 0, the function exits the while loop and returns the `ret` string, which represents the value of `x` in the new base. \n\nOverall, the function converts a number from one base to another by repeatedly taking the remainder of the number when divided by the new base and concatenating it to the beginning of a string, until the number becomes 0. The resulting string represents the original number in the new base. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (change_base x base)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_12_longest", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (longest strings)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_12_longest.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate longest))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"x\" \"y\" \"z\")) \"x\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"x\" \"yyy\" \"zzzz\" \"www\" \"kkkk\" \"abc\")) \"zzzz\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This is done by using the `Math.max` function to find the maximum value of an array of numbers, and the spread operator (`...`) to pass the lengths of the strings in the array to the `Math.max` function.\n5. `for(let s of strings){` - loops through each string in the array.\n6. `if(s.length == maxlen){` - checks if the length of the current string is equal to the maximum length.\n7. `return s;` - if the length of the current string is equal to the maximum length, the function returns that string.\n8. `}` - closes the if statement.\n9. `}` - closes the for loop.\n10. `}` - closes the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (longest strings)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_116_sort_array", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (sort_array arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_116_sort_array.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate sort_array))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 5 2 3 4)) (list 1 2 4 3 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -2 -3 -4 -5 -6)) (list -4 -2 -6 -5 -3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 0 2 3 4)) (list 0 1 2 4 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 5 77 4 5 3 5 7 2 3 4)) (list 2 2 4 4 3 3 5 5 5 7 77) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 6 44 12 32 5)) (list 32 3 5 6 12 44) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 8 16 32)) (list 2 4 8 16 32) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 8 16 32)) (list 2 4 8 16 32) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The sorting is done based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of the numbers in the array. If two numbers have the same number of 1's in their binary representation, they are sorted based on their numerical values.\n\n1. `function sort_array(arr){}` - This is a function declaration that takes an array as an argument and returns a sorted array.\n\n2. `return arr.sort((a, b) => {})` - This line sorts the array in ascending order based on the comparison function provided as an argument. The comparison function is defined using an arrow function.\n\n3. `return (a.toString(2).match(/1/g) || []).length - (b.toString(2).match(/1/g) || []).length || a - b;` - This is the comparison function that is used to sort the array. It compares two numbers `a` and `b` based on the number of 1's in their binary representation. \n\n4. `(a.toString(2).match(/1/g) || []).length` - This converts the number `a` to its binary representation using the `toString()` method with a radix of 2. The binary representation is then matched against a regular expression `/1/g` which matches all occurrences of the digit 1 in the binary representation. The resulting array is then returned and its length is used to determine the number of 1's in the binary representation of `a`. If there are no 1's in the binary representation, an empty array is returned and its length is 0.\n\n5. `(b.toString(2).match(/1/g) || []).length` - This is similar to the previous line, but it calculates the number of 1's in the binary representation of `b`.\n\n6. `|| a - b` - This is used to break ties when two numbers have the same number of 1's in their binary representation. If the number of 1's is the same for `a` and `b`, their numerical values are compared and the result of that comparison is returned. This is done using the logical OR operator `||`.

The function returns a new list that contains all the elements that are common to both `l1` and `l2`. \n\n1. The function `common` is defined with two parameters `l1` and `l2`.\n2. The `let` keyword is used to declare a new variable `ret` and initialize it with a new `Set` object. \n3. The `forEach` method is called on `l1` which iterates over each element `e1` in the list. \n4. For each element `e1` in `l1`, the `forEach` method is called on `l2` which iterates over each element `e2` in the list. \n5. For each element `e2` in `l2`, an `if` statement checks if `e1` is equal to `e2`. If they are equal, then `e1` is added to the `ret` set using the `add` method. \n6. The `Array.from` method is called on `ret` to convert the set to an array. \n7.

The conjecture states that for any positive integer n, if n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n1. `function get_odd_collatz(n){` - defines a function called `get_odd_collatz` that takes a single argument `n`.\n2. `let odd_collatz = n%2 == 0 ? [] : [n];` - declares a variable `odd_collatz` and assigns it an empty array if `n` is even, otherwise it assigns it an array with `n` as its only element.\n3. `while(n > 1){` - starts a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 1.\n4. `if(n%2 == 0){` - checks if `n` is even.\n5. `n = n/2;` - if `n` is even, divides it by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`.\n6. `}else{` - if `n` is not even (i.e. it's odd), the code jumps to this line.\n7. `n = n*3 + 1;` - multiplies `n` by 3 and adds 1 to the result, then assigns the result back to `n`.\n8. `}` - closes the if/else block.\n9. `if(n%2 == 1){` - checks if `n` is odd.\n10. `odd_collatz.push(n);` - if `n` is odd, adds it to the `odd_collatz` array.\n11. `}` - closes the if block.\n12. `}` - closes the while loop.\n13. `return odd_collatz.sort((a,b) => a-b);` - returns the `odd_collatz` array sorted in ascending order. The `sort` method is called on the array and takes a function that compares two elements `a` and `b`. The function returns a negative value if `a` is less than `b`, 0 if they are equal, and a positive value if `a` is greater than `b`. This ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (get_odd_collatz n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_62_derivative", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (derivative xs)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_62_derivative.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate derivative))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 1 2 4 5)) (list 1 4 12 20) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3)) (list 2 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1)) (list 2 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1 0 4)) (list 2 2 0 16) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1)) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new array of numbers which represent the derivative of the input array. \n\nThe function uses the `map` method to iterate over each element of the input array. The `map` method takes a function as an argument which is applied to each element of the array. The function passed to `map` takes two arguments, `x` and `i`, which represent the current element of the array and its index respectively. The function multiplies `x` by `i` and returns the result. \n\nThe `slice` method is then used to return a new array which contains all elements of the original array except for the first element. This is because the derivative of a function is defined as the difference between consecutive values of the function, and the first value of the derivative is undefined. \n\nFinally, the `return` statement is used to return the new array containing the derivative of the input array.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (derivative xs)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_63_fibfib", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (fibfib n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_63_fibfib.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate fibfib))\n    (check-within (candidate 2) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) 24 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) 81 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12) 274 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 14) 927 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Racket.\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction prime_fib(n){\n  function is_prime(p){\n    if(p < 2){\n      return false;\n    }\n    for(let k=2; k<=Math.min(Math.floor(Math.sqrt(p))+1, p-1); k++){\n      if(p % k === 0){\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    return true;\n  }\n  let f = [0, 1];\n  while(true){\n    f.push(f[f.length-1] + f[f.length-2]);\n    if(is_prime(f[f.length-1])){\n      n--;\n    }\n    if(n === 0){\n      return f[f.length-1];\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `prime_fib` that takes in a single argument `n`. The function returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that is also a prime number. \n\n1. `function prime_fib(n){` - This line declares a function called `prime_fib` that takes in a single argument `n`.\n\n2. `function is_prime(p){` - This line declares a nested function called `is_prime` that takes in a single argument `p`. This function will be used to check if a number is prime.\n\n3. `if(p < 2){` - This line checks if the argument `p` is less than 2.\n\n4. `return false;` - This line returns `false` if `p` is less than 2.\n\n5. `for(let k=2; k<=Math.min(Math.floor(Math.sqrt(p))+1, p-1); k++){` - This line declares a `for` loop that initializes a variable `k` to 2, and continues looping as long as `k` is less than or equal to the minimum value between the square root of `p` rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1, and `p` minus 1.\n\n6. `if(p % k === 0){` - This line checks if `p` is evenly divisible by `k`.\n\n7. `return false;` - This line returns `false` if `p` is evenly divisible by `k`.\n\n8. `return true;` - This line returns `true` if `p` is not evenly divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `p` rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1.\n\n9. `let f = [0, 1];` - This line initializes an array called `f` with the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n10. `while(true){` - This line declares a `while` loop that will continue indefinitely.\n\n11. `f.push(f[f.length-1] + f[f.length-2]);` - This line adds the sum of the last two numbers in the `f` array to the end of the array.\n\n12. `if(is_prime(f[f.length-1])){` - This line checks if the last number in the `f` array is prime.\n\n13. `n--;` - This line decrements the value of `n` by 1.\n\n14. `if(n === 0){` - This line checks if `n` is equal to 0.\n\n15. `return f[f.length-1];` - This line returns the last number in the `f` array if `n` is equal to 0. This is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that is also a prime number. \n\n16. `}` - This line closes the `if` statement.\n\n17. `}` - This line closes the `while` loop.\n\nOverall, the function generates the Fibonacci sequence and checks if each number is prime until it finds the nth number in the sequence that is also prime. It then returns that number. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (prime_fib n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_8_sum_product", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (sum_product numbers)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_8_sum_product.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate sum_product))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list 0 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 1 1)) (list 3 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 100 0)) (list 100 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 5 7)) (list 15 105) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 10)) (list 10 10) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an array of words in the string `s` that have `n` consonants. \n\n1. `function select_words(s, n){}` - This line defines the function `select_words` that takes two arguments, a string `s` and a number `n`.\n\n2. `let result = [];` - This line initializes an empty array called `result` that will be used to store the words that have `n` consonants.\n\n3. `s.split(\" \").forEach(word => {})` - This line splits the string `s` into an array of words using the space character as a delimiter. It then iterates over each word in the array using the `forEach` method and passes a function that takes a single argument `word`.\n\n4. `let n_consonants = 0;` - This line initializes a variable called `n_consonants` to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of consonants in each word.\n\n5. `for(let i=0; i<word.length; i++){}` - This line starts a `for` loop that iterates over each character in the current word.

The function returns the sum of the first `k` elements of the array `arr` that have a length of 2 or less. If the array `arr` has less than `k` elements, the function returns the sum of all elements that have a length of 2 or less.\n\n1. `function add_elements(arr, k){` - This line declares a function called `add_elements` that takes two arguments, an array `arr` and a number `k`.\n\n2. `return arr.slice(0,k).reduce((a,b) => (String(b).length <= 2) ? a+b : a, 0);` - This line returns the sum of the first `k` elements of the array `arr` that have a length of 2 or less.\n\n3. `arr.slice(0,k)` - This part of the line returns a new array that contains the first `k` elements of the array `arr`.\n\n4. `.reduce((a,b) => (String(b).length <= 2) ? a+b : a, 0)` - This part of the line applies a function to each element of the array `arr.slice(0,k)` to reduce it to a single value. The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns either `a+b` or `a`, depending on whether the length of `b` is less than or equal to 2. The `0` at the end of the line is the initial value of `a`.\n\n5. `(String(b).length <= 2) ? a+b : a` - This part of the line is a ternary operator that returns either `a+b` or `a`, depending on whether the length of `b` is less than or equal to 2. `String(b)` converts `b` to a string, and `.length` returns the length of the string. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (add_elements arr k)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_159_eat", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (eat number need remaining)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_159_eat.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate eat))\n    (check-within (candidate 5 6 10) (list 11 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 8 9) (list 12 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 10 10) (list 11 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 11 5) (list 7 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 5 7) (list 9 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 5 1) (list 5 0) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an array with two elements: the first element is the sum of `number` and `need` if `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`.

The function returns an array of arrays, where each subarray contains two elements, representing the row and column indices of the occurrences of `x` in `lst`. The returned array is sorted first by row index, and then by column index.\n\nThe function starts by initializing an empty array called `coords`, which will be used to store the row and column indices of the occurrences of `x`. \n\nThe function then loops through each element of `lst` using a `for` loop, and for each element, it loops through each element of the subarray using another `for` loop. \n\nIf the current element of `lst` is equal to `x`, the function pushes an array containing the current row index and the current column index to the `coords` array. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `coords` array, sorted by row index and then by column index. The sorting is done using the `sort` method, which takes a comparison function as an argument. The comparison function compares two subarrays, `a` and `b`, and returns a negative number if `a` should come before `b`, a positive number if `a` should come after `b`, and 0 if they are equal. In this case, the comparison function first compares the row indices of `a` and `b`, and if they are equal, it compares the column indices of `b` and `a` (note the reversed order). This ensures that the returned array is sorted first by row index, and then by column index.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (get_row lst x)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_29_filter_by_prefix", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (filter_by_prefix strings prefix)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_29_filter_by_prefix.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate filter_by_prefix))\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) \"john\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"xxx\" \"asd\" \"xxy\" \"john doe\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") \"xxx\") (list \"xxx\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new array of strings that start with the `prefix`. \n\nThe `filter` method is called on the `strings` array.

In this case, the provided function is an arrow function that takes in a single argument `x`. The arrow function returns a boolean value indicating whether the string `x` starts with the `prefix`. \n\nThe `startsWith` method is called on the string `x` to check if it starts with the `prefix`. The `startsWith` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the string starts with the specified characters. \n\nFinally, the `filter_by_prefix` function returns the new array of strings that start with the `prefix`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (filter_by_prefix strings prefix)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_102_choose_num", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (choose_num x y)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_102_choose_num.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate choose_num))\n    (check-within (candidate 12 15) 14 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 13 12) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 33 12354) 12354 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5234 5233) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6 29) 28 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 27 10) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 7) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 546 546) 546 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If it is, then `running_max` is set to the current number. Otherwise, `running_max` is set to the maximum value between `running_max` and the current number using the `Math.max()` function.\n\nThe current value of `running_max` is then pushed to the `result` array.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` array which contains the rolling maximum values of the input array. \n\nEssentially, the function takes an array of numbers and returns an array of the maximum value seen so far as it iterates through the input array. For example, if the input array is `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`, the output array would be `[1, 3, 3, 5, 5]` since the maximum value seen so far at each iteration is `[1, 3, 3, 5, 5]` respectively. \n\nThe function assumes that the input array is not empty.

If the number is not already in the `c` object, it is added with a count of 1. If the number is already in the `c` object, its count is incremented by 1.\n\n3. `return numbers.filter(n => c[n] <= 1);` returns a new array that contains only the numbers from the input array that have a count of 1 or less in the `c` object. This effectively removes any duplicates from the input array. \n\nOverall, the function works by counting the occurrences of each number in the input array and then filtering out any numbers that occur more than once. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (remove_duplicates numbers)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_nested_parens paren_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate parse_nested_parens))\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\") (list 2 3 1 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"() (()) ((())) (((())))\") (list 1 2 3 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()(())((())))\") (list 4) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The integers represent the maximum depth of nested parentheses in each group of parentheses in the input string. \n\nThe function `parse_nested_parens` contains an inner function called `parse_paren_group`. This function takes a string of parentheses and returns the maximum depth of nested parentheses in that string. \n\nThe `parse_nested_parens` function first splits the input string by spaces using the `split` method. It then filters out any empty strings using the `filter` method with an arrow function that returns `true` for non-empty strings. Finally, it maps each non-empty string to its maximum nested parentheses depth using the `parse_paren_group` function.\n\nThe `parse_paren_group` function initializes two variables, `depth` and `max_depth`, to 0. It then iterates over each character in the input string using a `for...of` loop. If the character is an opening parenthesis, `depth` is incremented by 1 and `max_depth` is updated to the maximum of `depth` and `max_depth`. If the character is a closing parenthesis, `depth` is decremented by 1. The function returns `max_depth` after iterating over all characters in the input string. \n\nOverall, the `parse_nested_parens` function takes a string of nested parentheses, splits it into groups, and returns an array of integers representing the maximum depth of nested parentheses in each group. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_nested_parens paren_string)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_155_even_odd_count", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (even_odd_count num)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_155_even_odd_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate even_odd_count))\n    (check-within (candidate 7) (list 0 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -78) (list 1 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3452) (list 2 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 346211) (list 3 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -345821) (list 3 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -2) (list 1 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -45347) (list 2 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 0) (list 1 0) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all the integers in `s`.\n\n1. `let lis = []` creates an empty list called `lis`.\n2. `for(let i of s.split(' ')){}` iterates over each element of the array `s` created by splitting the string `s` at every space character.\n3. `if(i.match(/\\d+/))` checks if the current element `i` contains one or more digits.\n4. `lis.push(parseInt(i))` converts the current element `i` to an integer and appends it to the list `lis`.\n5. `return n - lis.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0)` returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all the integers in `lis`. The `reduce` method is used to sum all the integers in `lis`. The `0` argument is the initial value of the accumulator `a`.

It returns true if `x` is even and `i` is odd. \n3. `.reduce((a,b) => a+b,0)` - This line reduces the filtered array to a single value, which is the sum of all its elements. \n    - `.reduce` - This is a built-in method in JavaScript that applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.\n    - `(a,b) => a+b` - This is an arrow function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.

The function checks if the two strings contain matching parentheses. If the parentheses match, the function returns the string 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'.\n\nThe function contains an inner function called `check` that takes in a string as an argument and returns a boolean value. The `check` function checks if the parentheses in the string are balanced. If they are, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe `match_parens` function first concatenates the two strings in the list in two different orders and stores them in variables `S1` and `S2`. The function then checks if either `S1` or `S2` has balanced parentheses by calling the `check` function on each of them. If either `S1` or `S2` has balanced parentheses, the function returns the string 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'. \n\nThe `check` function works by iterating over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, if it is an opening parenthesis, the function increments a variable `val` by 1. If it is a closing parenthesis, the function decrements `val` by 1. If `val` ever becomes negative, the function returns `false` because this means there is a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis. If the function reaches the end of the string and `val` is equal to 0, the function returns `true` because this means all opening parentheses have a matching closing parenthesis. If `val` is not equal to 0 at the end of the string, the function returns `false` because this means there is an opening parenthesis without a matching closing parenthesis. \n\nOverall, the `match_parens` function checks if the two strings in the input list have matching parentheses by concatenating them in different orders and checking if either of them has balanced parentheses. If either string has balanced parentheses, the function returns 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (match_parens lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (filter_by_substring strings substring)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate filter_by_substring))\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) \"john\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"xxx\" \"asd\" \"xxy\" \"john doe\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") \"xxx\") (list \"xxx\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"xxx\" \"asd\" \"aaaxxy\" \"john doe\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") \"xx\") (list \"xxx\" \"aaaxxy\" \"xxxAAA\" \"xxx\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"grunt\" \"trumpet\" \"prune\" \"gruesome\") \"run\") (list \"grunt\" \"prune\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If there are multiple strings with the same number of unique characters, the function returns the first string in alphabetical order.\n\n1. `function find_max(words){` - defines a function `find_max` that takes an array of strings `words` as an argument.\n2. `return words.sort((a, b) => {` - sorts the array of strings `words` in ascending order based on the result of the comparison function passed as an argument to the `sort` method. The comparison function takes two strings `a` and `b` as arguments and returns a negative number if `a` should come before `b`, a positive number if `a` should come after `b`, and 0 if `a` and `b` are equal. \n3. `return (new Set(b)).size - (new Set(a)).size || a.localeCompare(b);` - the comparison function that compares two strings `a` and `b` based on the number of unique characters in each string.

The second argument to `Array.from` is a function that is called for each element of the array. The first argument to this function is the current element being processed, which is ignored in this case. The second argument is the index of the current element, which is added to `lower` to get the actual value of the element. \n\nThe resulting array is then filtered using the `filter` method to only include even integers. This is done by checking if the remainder of the integer divided by 2 is equal to 0. \n\nOverall, the function generates an array of even integers between 2 and 8, or between `a` and `b` if either of those values is outside that range. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (generate_integers a b)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_110_exchange", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (exchange lst1 lst2)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_110_exchange.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate exchange))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4) (list 1 2 3 4)) \"YES\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4) (list 1 5 3 4)) \"NO\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4) (list 2 1 4 3)) \"YES\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 7 3) (list 2 6 4)) \"YES\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 7 3) (list 2 6 3)) \"NO\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 6 1 8 9) (list 3 5 5 1 1 1)) \"NO\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 100 200) (list 200 200)) \"YES\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns \"YES\" if the number of even numbers in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the number of odd numbers in `lst1`. Otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\n1. `function exchange(lst1, lst2){` - declares a function named `exchange` that takes two arguments `lst1` and `lst2`.\n2. `let odd = lst1.filter(i => i%2 === 1).length;` - declares a variable `odd` and assigns it the length of the filtered `lst1` array. The filter function returns a new array containing only the odd numbers from `lst1`. The length property returns the number of elements in the new array.\n3. `let even = lst2.filter(i => i%2 === 0).length;` - declares a variable `even` and assigns it the length of the filtered `lst2` array. The filter function returns a new array containing only the even numbers from `lst2`. The length property returns the number of elements in the new array.\n4. `return even >= odd ? \"YES\" : \"NO\";` - returns \"YES\" if `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`. Otherwise, it returns \"NO\". The `?` and `:` are part of the ternary operator, which is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. If the condition before the `?` is true, the expression before the `:` is returned. Otherwise, the expression after the `:` is returned. In this case, if `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`, \"YES\" is returned. Otherwise, \"NO\" is returned. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (exchange lst1 lst2)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_156_int_to_mini_roman", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (int_to_mini_roman number)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_156_int_to_mini_roman.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate int_to_mini_roman))\n    (check-within (candidate 19) \"xix\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 152) \"clii\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 251) \"ccli\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 426) \"cdxxvi\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 500) \"d\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) \"i\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) \"iv\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 43) \"xliii\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 90) \"xc\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 94) \"xciv\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 532) \"dxxxii\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 900) \"cm\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 994) \"cmxciv\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1000) \"m\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `int_to_mini_roman` and takes an integer `number` as an argument.\n2. An array `num` is defined with the values of the Roman numerals in descending order. \n3. An array `sym` is defined with the symbols of the Roman numerals in the same order as `num`.\n4. A variable `i` is initialized to 12, which is the index of the largest Roman numeral `M` in the `num` array.\n5. A variable `res` is initialized to an empty string.\n6. A while loop is used to iterate through the `num` array and calculate the Roman numeral equivalent of the input `number`. The loop continues as long as `number` is not zero.\n7. Inside the loop, a variable `div` is defined as the integer division of `number` and the current value of `num[i]`.\n8. The remainder of `number` divided by `num[i]` is assigned back to `number`.\n9. Another while loop is used to add the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to `res` `div` number of times.\n10. The index `i` is decremented by 1 to move to the next smaller Roman numeral in the `num` array.\n11. Once the loop has finished, the function returns `res` in lowercase. \n\nThe function works by repeatedly dividing the input `number` by the largest Roman numeral value that is less than or equal to it, and adding the corresponding symbol to the result string `res`. The process continues with the next smaller Roman numeral until the input `number` is reduced to zero. The function returns the result string in lowercase. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (int_to_mini_roman number)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_138_is_equal_to_sum_even", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_equal_to_sum_even n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_138_is_equal_to_sum_even.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_equal_to_sum_even))\n    (check-within (candidate 4) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 13) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 16) #t 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `n%2 == 0` checks if `n` is even, and `n >= 8` checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8. The `&&` operator combines the two conditions and returns `true` only if both conditions are `true`. \n\nTherefore, the function checks if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (is_equal_to_sum_even n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_79_decimal_to_binary", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (decimal_to_binary decimal)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_79_decimal_to_binary.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate decimal_to_binary))\n    (check-within (candidate 0) \"db0db\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 32) \"db100000db\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 103) \"db1100111db\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 15) \"db1111db\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function `decimal_to_binary` and the parameter `decimal` in parentheses. \n2. The function returns a string that concatenates the string \"db\" with the binary representation of the decimal number `decimal`, which is obtained by calling the `toString()` method on the decimal number with a radix of 2. \n3. The `toString()` method converts the decimal number to a string with the specified radix, which in this case is 2, representing binary. \n4. The resulting binary string is then concatenated with the string \"db\" to form the final output string. \n5. The function ends with the closing curly brace. \n\nTherefore, if the function is called with a decimal number of 10, it will return the string \"db1010db\", which represents the binary equivalent of 10. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (decimal_to_binary decimal)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_33_sort_third", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (sort_third l)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_33_sort_third.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate sort_third))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 6 3 4 8 9 2)) (list 2 6 3 4 8 9 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 8 3 4 6 9 2)) (list 2 8 3 4 6 9 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 6 9 4 8 3 2)) (list 2 6 9 4 8 3 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 6 3 4 8 9 2 1)) (list 2 6 3 4 8 9 5 1) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a boolean value.\n\n1. `let [a, b] = x.split(\"/\");` - This line uses destructuring assignment to split the string `x` into two parts, `a` and `b`, using the `/` character as the separator. The `split()` method returns an array of two elements, which are then assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.\n\n2. `let [c, d] = n.split(\"/\");` - This line is similar to the previous one, but it splits the string `n` into two parts, `c` and `d`.\n\n3. `let numerator = parseInt(a) * parseInt(c);` - This line converts the string values of `a` and `c` to integers using the `parseInt()` function, and then multiplies them together to get the numerator of the simplified fraction.\n\n4. `let denom = parseInt(b) * parseInt(d);` - This line is similar to the previous one, but it calculates the denominator of the simplified fraction.\n\n5. `return numerator/denom == parseInt(numerator/denom);` - This line divides the numerator by the denominator and checks if the result is an integer. If it is, then the fraction is simplified and the function returns `true`.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the three arguments form a right-angled triangle or not. \n\nThe function checks if the square of one side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If this condition is true for any of the three sides, the function returns `true`, indicating that the given triangle is a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, the function returns `false`. \n\nThe function uses the Pythagorean theorem to check if the given triangle is a right-angled triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nThe function checks this condition for all three sides of the triangle using the `==` operator. If the condition is true for any of the three sides, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. \n\nThe function is written in JavaScript, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language used primarily for web development. It is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime rather than at compile time. \n\nOverall, the `right_angle_triangle` function is a simple implementation of the Pythagorean theorem in JavaScript, used to determine whether a given set of three sides form a right-angled triangle or not. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (right_angle_triangle a b c)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_151_double_the_difference", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (double_the_difference lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_151_double_the_difference.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate double_the_difference))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5.0 4.0)) 25 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0.1 0.2 0.3)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -10.0 -20.0 -30.0)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1.0 -2.0 8.0)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0.2 3.0 5.0)) 34 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -9.0 -7.0 -5.0 -3.0 -1.0 1.0 3.0 5.0 7.0 9.0)) 165 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the sum of the squares of all odd positive integers in the list.\n\n1. `function double_the_difference(lst){}` - defines a function called `double_the_difference` that takes a list as an argument.\n2. `return lst.filter(i => i > 0 && i%2!=0 && !/\\./.test(i)).reduce((a,b) => a + b**2, 0)` - returns the result of filtering the list to only include odd positive integers that do not contain a decimal point, and then reducing the filtered list to the sum of the squares of its elements. \n\n   - `lst.filter(i => i > 0 && i%2!=0 && !/\\./.test(i))` - filters the list to only include elements that are greater than 0, odd, and do not contain a decimal point. \n   \n   - `.reduce((a,b) => a + b**2, 0)` - reduces the filtered list to the sum of the squares of its elements, starting with an initial value of 0. \n\n     - `(a,b) => a + b**2` - a function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the sum of `a` and the square of `b`. \n\n     - `0` - the initial value of `a` in the reduce function. \n\n     - `b**2` - the square of `b`. \n\n     - `!/\\./.test(i)` - a regular expression that tests whether the element `i` contains a decimal point. The `!` negates the result of the test, so the filter only includes elements that do not contain a decimal point. \n\n     - `i%2!=0` - a modulo operator that tests whether the element `i` is odd. If the remainder of `i` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, then `i` is odd. \n\n     - `i > 0` - a comparison operator that tests whether the element `i` is greater than 0. If `i` is greater than 0, then it is a positive integer. \n\n     - `i =>` - an arrow function that takes an argument `i`. This is a shorthand way of defining a function that takes one argument. \n\nOverall, the function `double_the_difference` returns the sum of the squares of all odd positive integers in the input list. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (double_the_difference lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_137_compare_one", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (compare_one a b)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_137_compare_one.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate compare_one))\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2) 2 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2.5) 2.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 3) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5 6) 6 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 \"2,3\") \"2,3\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"5,1\" \"6\") \"6\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"1\" \"2\") \"2\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"1\" 1) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This means that `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. This is a way to swap the values of `a` and `b` while also updating `b` to be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n4. `return a` - returns the value of `a` after the while loop has finished executing.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is monotonic or not. A list is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.\n\nThe function uses the `every` method to check if the list is monotonic. The `every` method is called twice, once to check if the list is non-decreasing and once to check if the list is non-increasing. \n\nThe first `every` call checks if every element in the list is greater than or equal to the previous element. The second `every` call checks if every element in the list is less than or equal to the previous element. \n\nIf either of the `every` calls returns `true`, then the function returns `true`, indicating that the list is monotonic. Otherwise, the function returns `false`. \n\nThe `=>` symbol is an arrow function that takes two arguments, `x` and `i`. The arrow function is used as a callback function for the `every` method. The `x` argument represents the current element being processed, and the `i` argument represents the index of the current element. \n\nThe `||` symbol is the logical OR operator. It returns `true` if either of its operands is `true`. \n\nThe `>=` and `<=` symbols are comparison operators. They return `true` if the operands are greater than or equal to or less than or equal to each other, respectively. \n\nThe `[]` brackets are used to access elements in an array. In this case, `l[i-1]` is used to access the previous element in the list. \n\nThe `.` symbol is used to access properties and methods of an object. In this case, `every` is a method of the `Array` object. \n\nThe `function` keyword is used to define a function. In this case, it is used to define the `monotonic` function. \n\nThe `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function. In this case, it is used to return the boolean value indicating whether the list is monotonic or not. \n\nThe `:` symbol is not used in this code. \n\nThe `;` symbol is used to terminate a statement. In this case, it is used to terminate the `return` statement. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (monotonic l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_105_by_length", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (by_length arr)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_105_by_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate by_length))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 1 1 4 5 8 2 3)) (list \"Eight\" \"Five\" \"Four\" \"Three\" \"Two\" \"Two\" \"One\" \"One\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 -1 55)) (list \"One\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 -1 3 2)) (list \"Three\" \"Two\" \"One\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 9 4 8)) (list \"Nine\" \"Eight\" \"Four\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a new array that contains the length of each element in the original array, sorted in descending order. The length of each element is represented by a string that is the English word for the number of characters in the element. \n\nThe function starts by creating an object called `dic` that maps integers to their corresponding English word. The keys of the object are integers from 1 to 9, and the values are the corresponding English words. \n\nThe next line creates a new array called `sorted_arr` that is a sorted copy of the input array. The sorting is done using a comparison function that takes two elements `a` and `b` and returns `b-a`.

The function is defined with the name `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` and takes one parameter `txt`.\n2. The variable `check` is defined and assigned the value of the last word in the string `txt`. This is done by splitting the string into words using the space character as the delimiter, and then taking the last word using the `pop()` method.\n3. The function returns a boolean value that is `true` if the length of `check` is 1 and the character code of the lowercase version of the first character of `check` is between 97 and 122 (inclusive). \n4. The character code of a character can be obtained using the `charCodeAt()` method. The `toLowerCase()` method is used to convert the character to lowercase before getting its character code. \n\nOverall, the function checks if the last character of the input string is a letter by checking if the last word in the string has a length of 1 and its first character is a lowercase letter. If the condition is true, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (check_if_last_char_is_a_letter txt)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_77_iscube", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (iscube a)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_77_iscube.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate iscube))\n    (check-within (candidate 1) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate -1) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 64) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 180) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1000) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 0) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1729) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `Math.abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number, which is the number's distance from zero. This is done to ensure that the function works with negative numbers as well.\n\nThe second line of the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `a` is a perfect cube. A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the product of three equal integers. For example, 27 is a perfect cube because it can be expressed as 3 * 3 * 3.\n\nThe function checks whether the cube root of `a` is an integer by using the `Math.pow()` function to raise `a` to the power of 1/3 (which is the same as taking the cube root of `a`). The `Math.round()` function is then used to round the result of the cube root to the nearest integer. The result of this expression is then raised to the power of 3 using the `**` operator (which is the same as using `Math.pow()` with an exponent of 3). If this value is equal to `a`, then `a` is a perfect cube and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (iscube a)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_112_reverse_delete", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (reverse_delete s c)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_112_reverse_delete.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate reverse_delete))\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcde\" \"ae\") (list \"bcd\" #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcdef\" \"b\") (list \"acdef\" #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcdedcba\" \"ab\") (list \"cdedc\" #t) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"dwik\" \"w\") (list \"dik\" #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a\" \"a\") (list \"\" #t) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcdedcba\" \"\") (list \"abcdedcba\" #t) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcdedcba\" \"v\") (list \"abcdedcba\" #t) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"vabba\" \"v\") (list \"abba\" #t) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"mamma\" \"mia\") (list \"\" #t) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Math.min(...lst) : Math.max(...lst));` - If `switch_` is `true`, push the minimum value of the input list to `res`. Otherwise, push the maximum value of the input list to `res`.\n5. `lst.splice(lst.indexOf(res.slice(-1)[0]), 1);` - Remove the last element of `res` from the input list.\n6. `switch_ = !switch_;` - Flip the value of `switch_`.\n7. `}` - End the while loop.\n8. `return res;` - Return the sorted list.\n\nThe algorithm works by alternating between finding the minimum and maximum values of the input list and adding them to the result list. The last added value is then removed from the input list, and the process is repeated until the input list is empty. The boolean variable `switch_` is used to determine whether the minimum or maximum value should be added to the result list. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (strange_sort_list lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_91_is_bored", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_bored S)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_91_is_bored.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_bored))\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hello world\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Is the sky blue?\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"I love It !\") 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"bIt\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"I feel good today.

The `split` method takes a regular expression as an argument and splits the string into an array of substrings based on the matches of the regular expression. In this case, the regular expression is `/[.?!]\\s*/`, which matches any period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters. This effectively splits the string into an array of sentences.\n2. `return sentences.filter(sentence => sentence.slice(0,2) == 'I ').length;`\n   - This line returns the length of an array that is created by calling the `filter` method on the `sentences` array. The `filter` method takes a function as an argument and returns a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the function returns `true`. In this case, the function is an arrow function that takes a single argument `sentence` and returns `true` if the first two characters of `sentence` are `'I '`. The `slice` method is used to extract the first two characters of `sentence`. Finally, the `length` property is used to get the number of elements in the filtered array, which is the number of sentences that start with `'I '`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (is_bored S)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_14_all_prefixes", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (all_prefixes string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_14_all_prefixes.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate all_prefixes))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"asdfgh\") (list \"a\" \"as\" \"asd\" \"asdf\" \"asdfg\" \"asdfgh\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"WWW\") (list \"W\" \"WW\" \"WWW\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the sum of all odd numbers in the array that are in odd positions. \n\nThe function uses the `filter` method to filter out all even numbers and all odd numbers that are in even positions. The `filter` method takes a callback function that is executed on each element of the array. The callback function takes two arguments, the current element and its index. The callback function returns `true` if the element should be included in the filtered array and `false` otherwise. In this case, the callback function checks if the index is odd and the element is odd. If both conditions are true, the element is included in the filtered array.\n\nThe `reduce` method is then used to sum the filtered array. The `reduce` method takes a callback function that is executed on each element of the array. The callback function takes two arguments, the accumulator and the current element. The accumulator is the value returned by the previous iteration of the callback function. The callback function returns the new value of the accumulator. In this case, the callback function simply adds the current element to the accumulator.\n\nFinally, the `reduce` method returns the sum of all odd numbers in the array that are in odd positions. If the filtered array is empty, the `reduce` method returns `0`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (solution lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_126_is_sorted", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_sorted lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_126_is_sorted.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_sorted))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 3 2 4 5)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 3 2 4 5 6 7)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 2 2 3 4)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 3 3 4)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 2 3 3 4)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4)) #t 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an array containing the minimum even number in the input array and its index. If the input array is empty or does not contain any even numbers, the function returns an empty array.\n\nThe function first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty array. If it is not, the function filters the input array to create a new array containing only the even numbers. This is done using the `filter` method on arrays, which takes a function as an argument that returns `true` or `false` for each element in the array. In this case, the function checks if the remainder of the element divided by 2 is 0, which means the element is even. The resulting array of even numbers is stored in a variable called `evens`.\n\nThe function then checks if the `evens` array is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty array. If it is not, the function creates a new array containing the minimum value in the `evens` array and its index in the original input array. This is done using the `Math.min` function, which returns the minimum value in an array, and the `indexOf` method on arrays, which returns the index of the first occurrence of a given value in an array. The resulting array containing the minimum even number and its index is returned by the function. \n\nOverall, the `pluck` function filters an input array to create a new array containing only the even numbers, and then returns the minimum even number and its index in the original input array.

If the sum is zero, the function immediately returns `true` to indicate that a pair of numbers that add up to zero has been found.\n\nIf the function has iterated over all possible pairs of numbers without finding a pair that adds up to zero, it returns `false` to indicate that no such pair exists in the array.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (pairs_sum_to_zero l)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_10_make_palindrome", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (make_palindrome string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_10_make_palindrome.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate make_palindrome))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"x\") \"x\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"xyz\") \"xyzyx\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"xyx\") \"xyx\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"jerry\") \"jerryrrej\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. \n\n1. `function make_palindrome(string){` - defines a function called `make_palindrome` that takes a string as an input.\n\n2. `if (!string) return '';` - checks if the input string is empty or null. If it is, the function returns an empty string.\n\n3. `let beginning_of_suffix = 0;` - initializes a variable called `beginning_of_suffix` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the index where the suffix of the input string begins.\n\n4. `while (string.slice(beginning_of_suffix) !== string.slice(beginning_of_suffix).split('').reverse().join('')){` - creates a loop that will run as long as the suffix of the input string is not equal to its reverse. \n\n5. `beginning_of_suffix += 1;` - increments the `beginning_of_suffix` variable by 1 on each iteration of the loop.\n\n6. `}` - closes the while loop.\n\n7. `return string + string.slice(0, beginning_of_suffix).split('').reverse().join('');` - returns the input string concatenated with the reverse of its prefix up to the index where the suffix begins. This creates a palindrome. \n\nThe function works by finding the longest possible suffix of the input string that is also a palindrome. It then takes the prefix of the input string up to the index where the suffix begins, reverses it, and concatenates it with the original input string to create a palindrome. If the input string is already a palindrome, the function simply returns the input string. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (make_palindrome string)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_83_starts_one_ends", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (starts_one_ends n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_83_starts_one_ends.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate starts_one_ends))\n    (check-within (candidate 1) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2) 18 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3) 180 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) 1800 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) 18000 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns 1 if the argument is equal to 1, otherwise it returns 18 times 10 to the power of n minus 2. \n\nThe function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function, `starts_one_ends`, and the argument `n` in parentheses. \n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that uses a ternary operator to check if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1. If it is not, the function returns the result of the expression `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`. \n\nThe expression `10 ** (n - 2)` uses the exponentiation operator `**` to raise 10 to the power of `n - 2`. The result of this expression is then multiplied by 18 to give the final result. \n\nOverall, the function returns 1 if `n` is 1, and 18 times 10 to the power of `n - 2` otherwise. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (starts_one_ends n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_30_get_positive", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (get_positive l)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_30_get_positive.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate get_positive))\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -2 4 5 6)) (list 4 5 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 3 -5 2 3 3 9 0 123 1 -10)) (list 5 3 2 3 3 9 123 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -2)) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This function checks if a number `k` is prime or not. \n\nThe `is_prime` function first checks if the input number `k` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `false` because 1 and 0 are not prime numbers. \n\nIf `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the function enters a for loop that starts at 2 and goes up to `k-1`. Inside the loop, the function checks if `k` is divisible by `i` (the current iteration of the loop). If it is, the function returns `false` because `k` is not a prime number. If the loop completes without finding a factor of `k`, the function returns `true` because `k` is a prime number. \n\nBack in the `largest_prime_factor` function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1. \n\nThen, a for loop is started that goes from 2 up to `n+1`. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by the current iteration of the loop (`j`) and if `j` is a prime number (by calling the `is_prime` function). If both conditions are true, the function updates the `largest` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `j`. \n\nFinally, the `largest` variable is returned as the output of the `largest_prime_factor` function. \n\nOverall, the function finds the largest prime factor of `n` by checking all factors of `n` and keeping track of the largest prime factor found so far. The function uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime or not. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (largest_prime_factor n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_147_get_max_triples", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (get_max_triples n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_147_get_max_triples.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate get_max_triples))\n    (check-within (candidate 5) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) 36 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100) 53361 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `Array.from` method creates a new array from an array-like object or an iterable object. In this case, the array-like object is an object with a `length` property of `n`. The second argument to `Array.from` is a mapping function that maps each element of the array to a new value. In this case, the mapping function maps the index `i` of each element to the value `(i+1)*(i+1)-i`. This expression evaluates to `i^2 + i + 1`, which is the `i`th triangular number.\n2. `let ans = [];`\n   - This line initializes an empty array `ans` that will be used to store the triplets of integers that satisfy the condition.\n3. `for(let i=0; i<n; i++){`\n   - This line starts a loop that iterates over the indices `i` of the array `A`.\n4. `for(let j=i+1; j<n; j++){`\n   - This line starts a nested loop that iterates over the indices `j` of the array `A` such that `j` is greater than `i`.\n5. `for(let k=j+1; k<n; k++){`\n   - This line starts a nested loop that iterates over the indices `k` of the array `A` such that `k` is greater than `j`.\n6. `if((A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 === 0){`\n   - This line checks if the sum of the squares of the integers at indices `i`, `j`, and `k` of the array `A` is divisible by 3.

The function returns a modified version of the string where each word in the string is sorted alphabetically.\n\nThe function starts by splitting the string `s` into an array of words using the `split` method. The `split` method takes a delimiter as an argument and returns an array of substrings that are separated by the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space character `' '`. \n\nThe `map` method is then called on the array of words. The `map` method takes a function as an argument and applies the function to each element in the array. In this case, the function is an arrow function that takes a single argument `i`. The arrow function first converts the string `i` into an array of characters using the spread operator `...`. The spread operator is used to split the string into individual characters. The `sort` method is then called on the array of characters to sort them alphabetically. Finally, the `join` method is called on the sorted array of characters to convert it back into a string. The `join` method takes a delimiter as an argument and returns a string that concatenates all the elements in the array separated by the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is an empty string `''`.\n\nThe `map` method returns an array of sorted words. The `join` method is then called on the array of sorted words to concatenate them into a single string. The `join` method takes a delimiter as an argument and returns a string that concatenates all the elements in the array separated by the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space character `' '`. The final result is a modified version of the original string where each word is sorted alphabetically.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (anti_shuffle s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_84_solve", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (solve N)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_84_solve.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate solve))\n    (check-within (candidate 1000) \"1\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 150) \"110\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 147) \"1100\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 333) \"1001\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 963) \"10010\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It then splits the string into an array of individual digits using the `split('')` method. \n\nThe `reduce()` method is then called on the array of digits. The `reduce()` method takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value. The callback function takes two arguments: an accumulator (`a`) and a current value (`b`). The `reduce()` method applies the callback function to each element of the array, and returns a single value that is the result of the accumulation. \n\nIn this case, the callback function is an arrow function that takes two arguments (`a` and `b`) and returns the sum of the two arguments (`+a + +b`). The `+` operator is used to convert the string values of `a` and `b` to numbers before adding them together. The initial value of the accumulator is `0`.\n\nThe result of the `reduce()` method is then converted to a binary string using the `toString(2)` method. The `toString()` method is called on the result of the `reduce()` method, and the argument `2` specifies that the result should be converted to a binary string.\n\nThe final result of the function is the binary string.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (solve N)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_129_minPath", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (minPath grid k)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_129_minPath.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate minPath))\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6) (list 7 8 9)) 3) (list 1 2 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 5 9 3) (list 4 1 6) (list 7 8 2)) 1) (list 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 2 3 4) (list 5 6 7 8) (list 9 10 11 12) (list 13 14 15 16)) 4) (list 1 2 1 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 6 4 13 10) (list 5 7 12 1) (list 3 16 11 15) (list 8 14 9 2)) 7) (list 1 10 1 10 1 10 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 8 14 9 2) (list 6 4 13 15) (list 5 7 1 12) (list 3 10 11 16)) 5) (list 1 7 1 7 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 11 8 7 2) (list 5 16 14 4) (list 9 3 15 6) (list 12 13 10 1)) 9) (list 1 6 1 6 1 6 1 6 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 12 13 10 1) (list 9 3 15 6) (list 5 16 14 4) (list 11 8 7 2)) 12) (list 1 6 1 6 1 6 1 6 1 6 1 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 2 7 4) (list 3 1 5) (list 6 8 9)) 8) (list 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 6 1 5) (list 3 8 9) (list 2 7 4)) 8) (list 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)) 10) (list 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list (list 1 3) (list 3 2)) 10) (list 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This creates an array of length `n`. \n\nThe second argument to `Array.from` is a function that is called for each element in the array. \n\nThe function takes two arguments, the first is the value of the element (which is ignored in this case) and the second is the index of the element. \n\nThe function returns the value of `n + 2*i`, which is the value of the element at that index. \n\nOverall, the function creates an array of length `n` where each element is calculated using the formula `n + 2*i`. \n\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n(define (make_a_pile n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_31_is_prime", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_prime n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_31_is_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_prime))\n    (check-within (candidate 6) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 101) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 13441) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 61) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 17) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 85) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 77) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 255379) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.
