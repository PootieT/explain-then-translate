The function checks if it is possible to sort the array by moving only one element to a different position. If it is possible, the function returns `#t`, otherwise it returns `#f`.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the input array is empty. If it is, the function returns `#t` because an empty array is already sorted.\n\nIf the input array is not empty, the function creates a new array called `sorted-array` that is a sorted version of the input array. The function also creates an empty array called `my-arr`.\n\nThe function then finds the minimum value in the input array using the `min` function and stores it in a variable called `min-value`. It also finds the index of the minimum value in the input array using a helper function called `index-of` and stores it in a variable called `min-index`.\n\nThe function then creates a new array called `my-arr` by appending the elements of the input array after the minimum value to the elements of the input array before the minimum value. This effectively moves the minimum value to the front of the array.\n\nFinally, the function uses a `for/and` loop to check if each element of `my-arr` is equal to the corresponding element of `sorted-array`. If all elements are equal, the function returns `#t`, otherwise it returns `#f`.\n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction move_one_ball(arr::Vector{Int64})::Bool\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_131_digits", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function digits(n::Int64)::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_131_digits.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = digits;\n\t@test(candidate(5) == 5)\n\t@test(candidate(54) == 5)\n\t@test(candidate(120) == 1)\n\t@test(candidate(5014) == 5)\n\t@test(candidate(98765) == 315)\n\t@test(candidate(5576543) == 2625)\n\t@test(candidate(2468) == 0)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. \n\nThe function `fib4` takes in a single argument `n` which is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence to be computed. \n\nThe first line of the function defines a list `results` with four elements, `0`, `0`, `2`, and `0`. \n\nThe second line checks if `n` is less than 4. If it is, the function returns the nth element of the `results` list. This is because the first three elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, and 1, which are already defined in the `results` list. \n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the function enters the `begin` block. \n\nThe `for` loop iterates over a range of numbers from 4 to `n+1`. \n\nIn each iteration of the loop, the `results` list is updated by appending a new element to it. The new element is the sum of the last four elements of the `results` list. \n\nThe `car` function is then used to return the first element of the reversed `results` list, which is the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nTo rewrite this program in Julia, we can start by defining a function `fib4` that takes in a single argument `n`. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction fib4(n::Int64)::Int64\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_37_sort_even", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function sort_even(l::Vector{Int64})::Vector{Int64}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_37_sort_even.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = sort_even;\n\t@test(candidate([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3])\n\t@test(candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == [-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123])\n\t@test(candidate([5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10]) == [-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the maximum number of containers that can be filled with the given capacity.\n\nThe function starts by applying the `map` function to the `grid`. The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a list and returns a new list with the results. In this case, the function being applied is a lambda function that takes an array as input, sums its elements, divides the result by `capacity`, and then rounds up to the nearest integer using the `ceiling` function.

It uses a `cond` statement to check the value of the grade and return the appropriate letter grade. \n\nThe `numerical_letter_grade` function maps the `grade` function over the list of grades, returning a list of letter grades. \n\nThe `cond` statement checks the value of `gpa` and returns the corresponding letter grade. The first condition checks if `gpa` is equal to `4.0` and returns `\"A+\"` if true. The next condition checks if `gpa` is greater than `3.7` and returns `\"A\"` if true. The rest of the conditions follow the same pattern, checking if `gpa` is greater than a certain value and returning the corresponding letter grade. The last condition, `[else \"E\"]`, is the default case that returns `\"E\"` if none of the other conditions are true. \n\nThe `map` function applies the `grade` function to each element in the `grades` list, returning a new list of letter grades. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction numerical_letter_grade(grades::Vector{Float64})::Vector{String}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_150_x_or_y", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function x_or_y(n::Int64, x::Int64, y::Int64)::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_150_x_or_y.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = x_or_y;\n\t@test(candidate(7, 34, 12) == 34)\n\t@test(candidate(15, 8, 5) == 5)\n\t@test(candidate(3, 33, 5212) == 33)\n\t@test(candidate(1259, 3, 52) == 3)\n\t@test(candidate(7919, -1, 12) == -1)\n\t@test(candidate(3609, 1245, 583) == 583)\n\t@test(candidate(91, 56, 129) == 129)\n\t@test(candidate(6, 34, 1234) == 1234)\n\t@test(candidate(1, 2, 0) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate(2, 2, 0) == 2)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns `y` if `n` is equal to 1 or if `n` is not prime, otherwise it returns `x`.\n\nThe function uses the `cond` special form to check the conditions for returning `y` or `x`. The first condition checks if `n` is equal to 1, in which case it returns `y`. The second condition uses a `for/or` loop to check if `n` is divisible by any integer between 2 and `n-1`. If `n` is divisible by any integer in this range, then it is not prime, and the function returns `y`. The third condition is the else case, which means that `n` is prime, and the function returns `x`. \n\nThe `for/or` loop is used to iterate over a range of integers from 2 to `n-1`. The `in-range` function is used to generate the range of integers to iterate over. The `=` function is used to check if `n` is divisible by the current integer in the loop, and if so, the loop returns `true` and the `for/or` loop stops iterating. If none of the integers in the range divide `n`, then the loop returns `false` and the function proceeds to the next condition in the `cond` form. \n\nOverall, the function checks if `n` is prime and returns `x` or `y` accordingly. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction x_or_y(n::Int64, x::Int64, y::Int64)::Int64\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_146_specialFilter", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function specialFilter(nums::Vector{Int64})::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_146_specialFilter.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = specialFilter;\n\t@test(candidate([5, -2, 1, -5]) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate([15, -73, 14, -15]) == 1)\n\t@test(candidate([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) == 2)\n\t@test(candidate([43, -12, 93, 125, 121, 109]) == 4)\n\t@test(candidate([71, -2, -33, 75, 21, 19]) == 3)\n\t@test(candidate([1]) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate(Vector{Int64}([])) == 0)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined using the `define` keyword and takes a single argument `note`. The function body uses the `hash-ref` function to look up the integer value of the input note in the `note-map` hash table.\n\nThe third line inside the function uses the `filter-map` function to apply the `note->int` function to each music note in the input string and return a list of the resulting integer values. The `filter-map` function takes two arguments: the first is the function to apply to each element of the input list, and the second is the input list itself. In this case, the `note->int` function is applied to each element of the list returned by the `string-split` function, which splits the input string into a list of individual music notes based on the delimiter `\" \"`. The `filter-map` function filters out any `#f` values returned by the `note->int` function, which occur when the input note is not found in the `note-map` hash table.

(char->integer i)))) (string->list txt)))]))\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that takes a string as input and returns an integer. The integer represents the number of even numbered characters in the string that are lowercase. The function first checks if the string contains a space character. If it does, it splits the string into a list of words and returns the list. If the string does not contain a space character but contains a comma, it replaces the comma with a space and then splits the string into a list of words. If the string does not contain a space character or a comma, it converts the string into a list of characters, filters out all characters that are not lowercase or not even numbered, and returns the length of the resulting list. \n\nThe function is defined using the `define` keyword, followed by the function name `split_words`, and the input parameter `txt`. The function body is enclosed in parentheses and begins with a `cond` statement. The `cond` statement is a conditional expression that evaluates each clause in order until it finds one that is true. The first clause checks if the input string contains a space character using the `regexp-match?` function and the regular expression `#rx\" \"`. If the condition is true, the function splits the string into a list of words using the `string-split` function and returns the list. The second clause checks if the input string contains a comma character using the `regexp-match?` function and the regular expression `#rx\",\"`. If the condition is true, the function replaces the comma character with a space character using the `string-replace` function, splits the resulting string into a list of words using the `string-split` function, and returns the list. The third clause is an `else` clause that is executed if the previous two conditions are false. The clause converts the input string into a list of characters using the `string->list` function, filters out all characters that are not lowercase or not even numbered using the `filter` function and a lambda function that checks if the character is lowercase and even numbered, and returns the length of the resulting list using the `length` function. \n\nThe `char-lower-case?` function checks if a character is lowercase, and the `char->integer` function converts a character to its corresponding integer value. The `lambda` function is an anonymous function that takes a single input parameter `i` and returns `true` if `i` is lowercase and even numbered, and `false` otherwise. The `and` function is a logical operator that returns `true` if both of its input parameters are true, and `false` otherwise. The `even?` function checks if an integer is even. \n\nThe `define` statement is followed by the function name `split_words`, which is followed by the input parameter `txt`. The `cond` statement is enclosed in parentheses and consists of three clauses. The first clause checks if the input string contains a space character using the `regexp-match?` function and the regular expression `#rx\" \"`. If the condition is true, the function splits the string into a list of words using the `string-split` function and returns the list. The second clause checks if the input string contains a comma character using the `regexp-match?` function and the regular expression `#rx\",\"`. If the condition is true, the function replaces the comma character with a space character using the `string-replace` function, splits the resulting string into a list of words using the `string-split` function, and returns the list. The third clause is an `else` clause that is executed if the previous two conditions are false. The clause converts the input string into a list of characters using the `string\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction split_words(txt::String)::Union{Vector{String}, Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_16_count_distinct_characters", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function count_distinct_characters(string::String)::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_16_count_distinct_characters.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = count_distinct_characters;\n\t@test(candidate(\"\") == 0)\n\t@test(candidate(\"abcde\") == 5)\n\t@test(candidate(\"abcdecadeCADE\") == 5)\n\t@test(candidate(\"aaaaAAAAaaaa\") == 1)\n\t@test(candidate(\"Jerry jERRY JeRRRY\") == 5)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It returns `true` if `x` is a prime number and `false` otherwise. \n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if `x` is greater than 1 and if it is not divisible by any integer between 2 and `x-1`. It does this by using the `ormap` function to apply a lambda function to each integer in the range from 2 to `x-1`. The lambda function checks if `x` is divisible by the current integer and returns `true` if it is. The `ormap` function returns `true` if any of the lambda function applications return `true`, which means that `x` is not a prime number. The `not` function is used to invert this result, so that `is_prime` returns `true` if `x` is not divisible by any integer between 2 and `x-1`.\n\nThe `filter` function is used to apply the `is_prime` function to each integer in the range from 2 to `n-1` and return a list of all integers that are prime. The `range` function is used to generate a list of integers from 2 to `n-1`. \n\nOverall, the `count_up_to` function returns a list of all prime numbers up to `n`. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction count_up_to(n::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_133_sum_squares", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function sum_squares(lst::Vector{Float64})::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_133_sum_squares.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = sum_squares;\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) == 14)\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) == 14)\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0]) == 84)\n\t@test(candidate([1.4, 4.2, 0.0]) == 29)\n\t@test(candidate([-2.4, 1.0, 1.0]) == 6)\n\t@test(candidate([100.0, 1.0, 15.0, 2.0]) == 10230)\n\t@test(candidate([10000.0, 10000.0]) == 200000000)\n\t@test(candidate([-1.4, 4.6, 6.3]) == 75)\n\t@test(candidate([-1.4, 17.9, 18.9, 19.9]) == 1086)\n\t@test(candidate([0.0]) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate([-1.0]) == 1)\n\t@test(candidate([-1.0, 1.0, 0.0]) == 2)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a string that is the concatenation of `class_name` and the strongest extension in `extensions`. \n\nThe function starts by defining a variable `strong` that is the first element of `extensions`. It then defines a variable `my-val` that is the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in `strong`. \n\nThe function then iterates over the rest of the elements in `extensions` using a `for-each` loop. For each element `s`, it calculates the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in `s`, and stores it in a variable `val`. If `val` is greater than `my-val`, it sets `strong` to `s` and updates `my-val` to `val`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the concatenation of `class_name` and `strong`. \n\nTo rewrite the program in Julia, we would need to replace the Racket-specific syntax with Julia equivalents. For example, we would need to replace `#rx\"[A-Z]\"` with a regular expression that matches uppercase letters in Julia. We would also need to replace `regexp-match*` with a function that performs regular expression matching in Julia. Additionally, we would need to replace `for-each` with a loop construct in Julia, such as `foreach`. Finally, we would need to replace `set!` with an equivalent function in Julia that updates a variable. \n\nHere is an example of what the Julia code might look like:\n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction Strongest_Extension(class_name::String, extensions::Vector{String})::String\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function find_closest_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Tuple{Float64, Float64}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = find_closest_elements;\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) == (3.9, 4.0))\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0]) == (5.0, 5.9))\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) == (2.0, 2.2))\n\t@test(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]) == (2.0, 2.0))\n\t@test(candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]) == (2.2, 3.1))\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is a power of `n`. \n\nThe function works by first checking if `n` is equal to 1. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns true if and only if `x` is also equal to 1. This is because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself, so if `n` is 1, then `x` must also be 1 for `x` to be a power of `n`.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function enters a loop that keeps multiplying `n` by itself until the result is greater than or equal to `x`. If the result is equal to `x`, then `x` is a power of `n` and the function returns true. If the result is greater than `x`, then `x` is not a power of `n` and the function returns false.\n\nThe `let` expression defines a local function `loop` that takes one argument `power`. The `loop` function is called recursively with `power` being multiplied by `n` at each iteration until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `power` is equal to `x`, then `x` is a power of `n` and the function returns true. If `power` is greater than `x`, then `x` is not a power of `n` and the function returns false. \n\nThe `let` expression returns the result of the `loop` function. \n\nThe `if` expression is used to check whether `n` is equal to 1. If `n` is equal to 1, then the `if` expression returns true if and only if `x` is also equal to 1. If `n` is not equal to 1, then the `if` expression returns the result of the `let` expression. \n\nThe `=` operator is used to check for equality between two values. The `*` operator is used to multiply two values. The `<` operator is used to check if one value is less than another. The `let` expression is used to define a local function. The `loop` function is used to recursively multiply `n` by itself until the result is greater than or equal to `x`. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction is_simple_power(x::Int64, n::Int64)::Bool\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_93_encode", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function encode(message::String)::String\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_93_encode.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = encode;\n\t@test(candidate(\"TEST\") == \"tgst\")\n\t@test(candidate(\"Mudasir\") == \"mWDCSKR\")\n\t@test(candidate(\"YES\") == \"ygs\")\n\t@test(candidate(\"This is a message\") == \"tHKS KS C MGSSCGG\")\n\t@test(candidate(\"I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE\") == \"k dQnT kNqW wHcT Tq wRkTg\")\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function replaces all vowels in the string with a specific consonant, and swaps the case of each character in the string. \n\nThe function starts by defining two variables: `vowels` and `vowels-replace`. `vowels` is a string that contains all vowels in both uppercase and lowercase. `vowels-replace` is a hash table that maps each vowel to a specific consonant. \n\nThe function then defines two helper functions: `swap-case` and `replace-vowels`. `swap-case` takes a character and swaps its case. If the character is uppercase, it returns the lowercase version of the character, and vice versa. `replace-vowels` takes a character and returns the corresponding consonant if the character is a vowel, and the character itself otherwise. It does this by looking up the character in the `vowels-replace` hash table. If the character is not in the hash table, it returns the character itself. \n\nThe function then applies the `swap-case` function to each character in the input string using `map`. It then applies the `replace-vowels` function to each character in the modified string using `map`. Finally, it converts the resulting list of characters back into a string using `list->string` and returns the modified string. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction encode(message::String)::String\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_42_incr_list", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function incr_list(l::Vector{Int64})::Vector{Int64}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_42_incr_list.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = incr_list;\n\t@test(candidate(Vector{Int64}([])) == Vector{Int64}([]))\n\t@test(candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2])\n\t@test(candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The sorting is done based on the length of the strings, with shorter strings appearing first. \n\nThe function is defined using the `define` keyword. The `define` keyword is used to define variables, functions, and other values in Racket. The function takes a single argument `lst`, which is a list of strings.\n\nThe next line defines a helper function `even-length?` that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the length of the string is even. The function uses the `string-length` function to get the length of the string, and the `modulo` function to check if the length is even. If the length is even, the function returns `#t`, otherwise it returns `#f`.\n\nThe next line defines a new variable `new-lst` that is the result of filtering the input list `lst` using the `filter` function. The `filter` function takes a predicate function and a list, and returns a new list containing only the elements of the original list for which the predicate function returns `#t`. In this case, the predicate function is the `even-length?` function defined earlier, so `new-lst` is a list of strings with even length.\n\nThe final line of the function sorts the `new-lst` list using the `sort` function. The `sort` function takes a list and a comparison function, and returns a new list containing the elements of the original list sorted according to the comparison function. In this case, the comparison function is a lambda function that takes two strings `a` and `b` as input, and returns `#t` if the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, and `#f` otherwise. This sorts the list in ascending order of string length.\n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction sorted_list_sum(lst::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_101_words_string", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function words_string(s::String)::Vector{String}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_101_words_string.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = words_string;\n\t@test(candidate(\"Hi, my name is John\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"])\n\t@test(candidate(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"])\n\t@test(candidate(\"Hi, my name\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\"])\n\t@test(candidate(\"One,, two, three, four, five, six,\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"])\n\t@test(candidate(\"\") == Vector{String}([]))\n\t@test(candidate(\"ahmed     , gamal\") == [\"ahmed\", \"gamal\"])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function converts the integer to a string using `number->string`, then converts the string to a list of characters using `string->list`, reverses the list using `reverse`, and finally converts the reversed list back to a string using `list->string`. The function then checks if the original string and the reversed string are equal using `equal?`.\n\nThe function then initializes two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to 0.\n\nThe function then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each integer `i`, the function checks if `i` is odd and a palindrome using `(and (odd? i) (is_palindrome i))`. If this is true, the function increments `odd_palindrome_count` using `set!`. Similarly, if `i` is even and a palindrome, the function increments `even_palindrome_count`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a list of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction even_odd_palindrome(n::Int64)::Tuple{Int64, Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_95_check_dict_case", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function check_dict_case(dict::Dict{String, String}>)::Bool\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_95_check_dict_case.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = check_dict_case;\n\t@test(candidate(Dict(\"p\" => \"pineapple\", \"b\" => \"banana\")) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(Dict(\"p\" => \"pineapple\", \"A\" => \"banana\", \"B\" => \"banana\")) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(Dict(\"p\" => \"pineapple\", \"5\" => \"banana\", \"a\" => \"apple\")) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(Dict(\"Name\" => \"John\", \"Age\" => \"36\", \"City\" => \"Houston\")) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(Dict(\"STATE\" => \"NC\", \"ZIP\" => \"12345\")) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(Dict(\"fruit\" => \"Orange\", \"taste\" => \"Sweet\")) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(Dict()) == false)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The conjecture states that if you start with a positive integer n, then if n is even, divide it by 2, and if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until you reach 1. The conjecture states that no matter what positive integer you start with, you will eventually reach 1. \n\nThe function `get_odd_collatz` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. \n\nThe function `collatz-seq` is a helper function that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list of the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. The function uses a `cond` statement to check if `n` is equal to 1, even, or odd. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing 1. If `n` is even, the function returns a list containing `n` and the result of calling `collatz-seq` with `n/2`. If `n` is odd, the function returns a list containing `n` and the result of calling `collatz-seq` with `3n+1`. \n\nThe `let` statement in `get_odd_collatz` binds the variable `seq` to the result of calling `collatz-seq` with `n`. The `filter` function is then used to filter the list `seq` to only contain odd numbers. The `sort` function is then used to sort the resulting list in ascending order. The `<` operator is used to specify the sorting order. \n\nOverall, the program takes a positive integer `n` as input, generates the Collatz sequence starting from `n`, filters the sequence to only contain odd numbers, and returns a sorted list of the odd numbers in the sequence. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction get_odd_collatz(n::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_62_derivative", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function derivative(xs::Vector{Int64})::Vector{Int64}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_62_derivative.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = derivative;\n\t@test(candidate([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20])\n\t@test(candidate([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6])\n\t@test(candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [2, 2])\n\t@test(candidate([3, 2, 1, 0, 4]) == [2, 2, 0, 16])\n\t@test(candidate([1]) == Vector{Int64}([]))\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a list of words in the string `s` that have exactly `n` consonants. \n\nThe function `select_words` is defined using the `define` keyword. It takes in two arguments `s` and `n`. \n\nThe `consonant?` function is defined using the `define` keyword. It takes in a character `c` and returns `true` if the character is a consonant and `false` otherwise. A consonant is defined as any character that is not a vowel. The function checks if the character is not a member of the list of vowels `'(#\\a #\\e #\\i #\\o #\\u)` using the `not` and `member` functions.\n\nThe `count-consonants` function is defined using the `define` keyword. It takes in a word as a string and returns the number of consonants in the word. It does this by converting the string to a list of characters using `string->list` and then counting the number of consonants in the list using the `count` function and the `consonant?` function.\n\nThe `filter` function is called with two arguments. The first argument is an anonymous function that takes in a word and returns `true` if the number of consonants in the word is equal to `n` and `false` otherwise. The function does this by calling the `count-consonants` function on the word and comparing the result to `n`. The second argument is the list of words in the string `s` split using the `string-split` function. The `filter` function returns a new list of words that satisfy the condition in the anonymous function. \n\nThe `select_words` function returns the list of words returned by the `filter` function. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction select_words(s::String, n::Int64)::Vector{String}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_122_add_elements", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function add_elements(arr::Vector{Int64}, k::Int64)::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_122_add_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = add_elements;\n\t@test(candidate([1, -2, -3, 41, 57, 76, 87, 88, 99], 3) == -4)\n\t@test(candidate([111, 121, 3, 4000, 5, 6], 2) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate([11, 21, 3, 90, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4) == 125)\n\t@test(candidate([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4) == 24)\n\t@test(candidate([1], 1) == 1)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` that have a length of at most two digits. \n\nThe first line of the code defines the function `add_elements` and takes two arguments, `arr` and `k`. \n\nThe second line of the code uses the `apply` function to apply the `+` operator to the result of the `filter` function. The `filter` function takes two arguments, a lambda function and a list. The lambda function takes one argument, `x`, and returns `true` if the length of the string representation of `x` is less than or equal to two. The `take` function takes two arguments, a list and an integer, and returns the first `k` elements of the list. The `filter` function then filters the list of the first `k` elements of `arr` to only include elements with a length of at most two digits. The `apply` function then applies the `+` operator to the filtered list of elements to return their sum.\n\nIn summary, the `add_elements` function returns the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr` that have a length of at most two digits. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction add_elements(arr::Vector{Int64}, k::Int64)::Int64\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_159_eat", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function eat(number::Int64, need::Int64, remaining::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_159_eat.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = eat;\n\t@test(candidate(5, 6, 10) == [11, 4])\n\t@test(candidate(4, 8, 9) == [12, 1])\n\t@test(candidate(1, 10, 10) == [11, 0])\n\t@test(candidate(2, 11, 5) == [7, 0])\n\t@test(candidate(4, 5, 7) == [9, 2])\n\t@test(candidate(4, 5, 1) == [5, 0])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a list of two numbers, the first number is the amount of food eaten, and the second number is the amount of food remaining.\n\nThe function first checks if the amount of food needed (`need`) is less than or equal to the amount of food remaining (`remaining`). If it is, then the function returns a list where the first number is the sum of `number` and `need`, and the second number is the difference between `remaining` and `need`. If `need` is greater than `remaining`, then the function returns a list where the first number is the sum of `number` and `remaining`, and the second number is 0. \n\nIn other words, if there is enough food remaining to satisfy the need, then the function will eat the amount needed and return the amount eaten and the remaining food. If there is not enough food remaining, then the function will eat all the remaining food and return the amount eaten and 0 remaining food. \n\nThe function is written in Racket, a dialect of Lisp. The `define` keyword is used to define a function. The `if` statement is used to conditionally execute code based on a boolean expression. The `list` function is used to create a list of two numbers. The `+` and `-` operators are used to perform addition and subtraction, respectively. The `<=` operator is used to check if one number is less than or equal to another number. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction eat(number::Int64, need::Int64, remaining::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_113_odd_count", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function odd_count(lst::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_113_odd_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = odd_count;\n\t@test(candidate([\"1234567\"]) == [\"the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\"])\n\t@test(candidate([\"3\", \"11111111\"]) == [\"the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.\"])\n\t@test(candidate([\"271\", \"137\", \"314\"]) == [\"the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 3n the str3ng 3 of the 3nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.\"])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The output is a message that describes the number of odd elements in each string of the input list. \n\nThe function uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each element of the input list. The lambda function takes a string as input and returns a string as output. \n\nThe lambda function first converts the input string to a list of characters using the `string->list` function. It then uses the `count` function to count the number of characters in the list that represent odd numbers. To do this, it uses a nested lambda function that converts each character to a number using `string->number` and then checks if it is odd using the `odd?` function. \n\nThe lambda function then uses the `let` form to bind the result of the `count` function to the variable `n`.

The function returns a list of strings that start with the `prefix` argument. \n\nThe first line of the code defines the function `filter_by_prefix` with two arguments `strings` and `prefix`. \n\nThe second line of the code uses the `filter` function to filter the `strings` list. The `filter` function takes in two arguments, a predicate function and a list. The predicate function is a function that takes in an element of the list and returns a boolean value. The `filter` function returns a new list that contains only the elements of the original list for which the predicate function returns `true`. \n\nThe predicate function that is passed to the `filter` function is defined using the `lambda` keyword. The `lambda` keyword is used to define anonymous functions in Racket. The predicate function takes in an element of the `strings` list and checks if it starts with the `prefix` argument using the `string-prefix?` function. The `string-prefix?` function returns `true` if the first argument starts with the second argument. \n\nThe `filter` function returns a list of elements that satisfy the predicate function.

The function returns a number based on the following conditions:\n\n1. If `x` is greater than `y`, return `-1`.\n2. If `y` is even, return `y`.\n3. If `x` is equal to `y`, return `-1`.\n4. Otherwise, return `y - 1`.\n\nThe `cond` expression is used to check each of these conditions in order. The first condition checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, the function returns `-1`. The second condition checks if `y` is even. If it is, the function returns `y`. The third condition checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If it is, the function returns `-1`. The final condition is the \"else\" condition, which means that none of the previous conditions were true. In this case, the function returns `y - 1`.\n\nThe `even?` function is used to check if `y` is even. It returns `#t` if `y` is even and `#f` otherwise.\n\nThe `define` expression is used to define the `choose_num` function.

The `string->list` function is used to convert the string to a list of characters.\n\nInside the loop, an `if` statement is used to check if the current character is an opening parenthesis (`(`).

The `xor` function returns the character `#\\0` if `i` and `j` are equal, and `#\\1` otherwise. \n\nThe `map` function is used to apply the `xor` function to each corresponding pair of characters in the two input strings. The `map` function takes two arguments: the function to apply, and the list of arguments to apply the function to. In this case, the `map` function applies the `xor` function to each corresponding pair of characters in the two input strings `a` and `b`. \n\nThe `string->list` function is used to convert the input strings `a` and `b` into lists of characters. The `list->string` function is used to convert the list of characters resulting from the `map` function back into a string. \n\nOverall, the `string_xor` function takes two input strings, converts them to lists of characters, applies the `xor` function to each corresponding pair of characters in the two lists, and then converts the resulting list of characters back into a string. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction string_xor(a::String, b::String)::String\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_23_strlen", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function strlen(string::String)::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_23_strlen.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = strlen;\n\t@test(candidate(\"\") == 0)\n\t@test(candidate(\"x\") == 1)\n\t@test(candidate(\"asdasnakj\") == 9)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This is done using the `count` function, which takes two arguments: a predicate function that returns true for the elements to be counted, and a list to count the elements in. In this case, the predicate function is `odd?`, which returns true if its argument is odd.\n\nThe fourth line defines a variable `even` and assigns it the value of the number of even numbers in `lst2`. This is done using the `count` function again, but with the predicate function `even?`, which returns true if its argument is even.\n\nThe fifth line uses an `if` statement to check if `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`. If it is, the function returns the string \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns the string \"NO\". \n\nOverall, the function counts the number of odd and even numbers in the two input lists and returns \"YES\" if there are more even numbers in the second list than odd numbers in the first list. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction exchange(lst1::Vector{Int64}, lst2::Vector{Int64})::String\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_138_is_equal_to_sum_even", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int64)::Bool\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_138_is_equal_to_sum_even.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = is_equal_to_sum_even;\n\t@test(candidate(4) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(6) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(8) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(10) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(11) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(12) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(13) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(16) == true)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns `#t` if the list is sorted in non-descending or non-ascending order, and `#f` otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if the list is sorted in non-descending order by comparing the input list `l` with the sorted version of `l` in ascending order. If the two lists are equal, then the input list is sorted in non-descending order. If not, the function checks if the list is sorted in non-ascending order by comparing the input list `l` with the sorted version of `l` in descending order. If the two lists are equal, then the input list is sorted in non-ascending order. If neither condition is met, then the input list is not sorted in either order and the function returns `#f`.\n\nThe function makes use of two built-in Racket functions: `sort` and `equal?`. The `sort` function sorts a list in ascending or descending order depending on the second argument passed to it. In this case, `<` is passed as the second argument to sort the list in ascending order, and `>` is passed as the second argument to sort the list in descending order. The `equal?` function checks if two values are equal. In this case, it is used to compare the input list `l` with the sorted versions of `l` in ascending and descending order. The `or` function returns `#t` if either of its arguments are true, and `#f` otherwise. In this case, it is used to return `#t` if the input list is sorted in either non-descending or non-ascending order. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction monotonic(l::Vector{Int64})::Bool\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_105_by_length", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function by_length(arr::Vector{Int64})::Vector{String}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_105_by_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = by_length;\n\t@test(candidate([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]) == [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"])\n\t@test(candidate(Vector{Int64}([])) == Vector{String}([]))\n\t@test(candidate([1, -1, 55]) == [\"One\"])\n\t@test(candidate([1, -1, 3, 2]) == [\"Three\", \"Two\", \"One\"])\n\t@test(candidate([9, 4, 8]) == [\"Nine\", \"Eight\", \"Four\"])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

In this case, we are defining a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a single argument `numbers`.\n\nThe function body is enclosed in parentheses, which is the syntax for a `let` expression. The `let` expression is used to define local variables that are only visible within the scope of the expression. \n\nThe `let` expression defines two local variables: `min-number` and `max-number`. The `apply` function is used to apply the `min` and `max` functions to the `numbers` list, which returns the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. These values are then bound to the `min-number` and `max-number` variables.\n\nThe `map` function is used to apply a lambda function to each element of the `numbers` list. The lambda function takes a single argument `x` and returns the result of dividing the difference between `x` and `min-number` by the difference between `max-number` and `min-number`. This rescales `x` to the unit interval [0, 1]. The resulting list of rescaled numbers is returned by the `map` function and is the result of the `rescale_to_unit` function. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction rescale_to_unit(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Vector{Float64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_127_intersection", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function intersection(interval1::Tuple{Int64, Int64}, interval2::Tuple{Int64, Int64})::String\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_127_intersection.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = intersection;\n\t@test(candidate((1, 2), (2, 3)) == \"NO\")\n\t@test(candidate((-1, 1), (0, 4)) == \"NO\")\n\t@test(candidate((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) == \"YES\")\n\t@test(candidate((-2, 2), (-4, 0)) == \"YES\")\n\t@test(candidate((-11, 2), (-1, -1)) == \"NO\")\n\t@test(candidate((1, 2), (3, 5)) == \"NO\")\n\t@test(candidate((1, 2), (1, 2)) == \"NO\")\n\t@test(candidate((-2, -2), (-3, -2)) == \"NO\")\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function uses a `cond` expression to check if the input number is 0 or 1, in which case it returns `#f`. If the input number is 2, it returns `#t`. Otherwise, it uses a `for/and` loop to iterate over all numbers between 2 and the input number (exclusive) and checks if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the loop returns `#f`, indicating that the input number is not prime. If the loop completes without returning `#f`, the input number is prime and the function returns `#t`.\n\nThe `intersection` function then defines two local variables `l` and `r` that represent the left and right endpoints of the intersection of the two input intervals. The left endpoint is the maximum of the left endpoints of the two intervals, and the right endpoint is the minimum of the right endpoints of the two intervals. This ensures that `l` and `r` represent a valid interval that is contained within both input intervals.\n\nThe function then computes the length of the intersection by subtracting `l` from `r`. If the length is greater than 0 and is prime (as determined by the `is-prime` function), the function returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\".<|im_end|>\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction intersection(interval1::Tuple{Int64, Int64}, interval2::Tuple{Int64, Int64})::String\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_78_hex_key", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function hex_key(num::String)::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_78_hex_key.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = hex_key;\n\t@test(candidate(\"AB\") == 1)\n\t@test(candidate(\"1077E\") == 2)\n\t@test(candidate(\"ABED1A33\") == 4)\n\t@test(candidate(\"2020\") == 2)\n\t@test(candidate(\"123456789ABCDEF0\") == 6)\n\t@test(candidate(\"112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00\") == 12)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It uses the `let` keyword to define a local function called `loop`. \n\nThe `loop` function takes three arguments: `lst`, `res`, and `switch`. `lst` is the list of numbers to be sorted, `res` is the result list that will contain the sorted numbers, and `switch` is a boolean that is used to switch between finding the minimum and maximum values in the list.\n\nThe `let` keyword is used to define a local variable `x` which is assigned the minimum or maximum value in the list depending on the value of `switch`.\n\nThe `remove` function is used to remove the value of `x` from the list `lst`.\n\nThe `append` function is used to append the value of `x` to the result list `res`.\n\nThe `not` function is used to switch the value of `switch` between `true` and `false`.\n\nThe `if` statement is used to check if the list `lst` is empty. If it is, the result list `res` is returned. If it is not, the `loop` function is called recursively with the updated values of `lst`, `res`, and `switch`. \n\nThe `apply` function is used to apply the `min` or `max` function to the list `lst`. The `min` function returns the minimum value in the list, while the `max` function returns the maximum value in the list. \n\nOverall, the `strange_sort_list` function sorts the list by finding the minimum or maximum value in the list, removing it from the list, and appending it to the result list.

The length of the vector is the maximum value in the input list plus one, and all elements of the vector are initialized to 0.\n\nThe second line of the function uses a `for-each` loop to iterate over each element `i` in the input list. For each element, the corresponding index in the `frq` vector is incremented by 1 using `vector-set!`.\n\nThe third line of the function initializes a variable called `ans` to -1.\n\nThe fourth line of the function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each index `i` in the `frq` vector. For each index, the code checks if the value at that index is greater than or equal to the index itself. If it is, then the value of `ans` is set to the current index.\n\nThe final line of the function returns the value of `ans`.\n\nIn summary, the `search` function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the largest integer `i` such that the number of occurrences of `i` in the input list is greater than or equal to `i`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in Julia, you could define a function called `search` that takes an array as input, and use the `countmap` function to count the occurrences of each element in the array. Then you could use a `for` loop to iterate over each key-value pair in the resulting dictionary, and update a variable called `ans` if the value is greater than or equal to the key. Finally, you could return the value of `ans`.

If it is, then the function returns 1. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next line.\n\nThe next line multiplies 18 with 10 raised to the power of `n-2`. The `expt` function is used to raise 10 to the power of `n-2`. The `*` operator is used to multiply the result of the `expt` function with 18. The result of this multiplication is the output of the function. \n\nThe function returns 18 times 10 raised to the power of `n-2` if `n` is not equal to 1. \n\nThe function computes a number that starts with 1 and ends with n-1 zeros.

The `for` loop iterates over a range of numbers, and the `and` operator combines the results of each iteration. If all iterations return true, the `and` operator returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nThe `for/and` loop iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to the length of the string. The `in-range` function is used to create the range of numbers. \n\nFor each iteration, the `equal?` function is used to compare the character at the current index with the character at the opposite index. \n\nThe `string-ref` function is used to get the character at a specific index in the string. The first argument is the string, and the second argument is the index.\n\nThe opposite index is calculated by subtracting the current index from the length of the string minus one. This is done using the `-` function.\n\nIf the characters at each index are equal for all iterations, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.<|im_end|>\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction is_palindrome(text::String)::Bool\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_108_count_nums", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function count_nums(arr::Vector{Int64})::Int64\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_108_count_nums.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = count_nums;\n\t@test(candidate(Vector{Int64}([])) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate([-1, -2, 0]) == 0)\n\t@test(candidate([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]) == 6)\n\t@test(candidate([1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5]) == 5)\n\t@test(candidate([1, 100, 98, -7, 1, -1]) == 4)\n\t@test(candidate([12, 23, 34, -45, -56, 0]) == 5)\n\t@test(candidate([0, 1]) == 1)\n\t@test(candidate([1]) == 1)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Julia.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (minPath grid k)\n  (define n (length grid))\n  (define val (+ (* n n) 1))\n  (for ([i (in-range n)])\n    (for ([j (in-range n)])\n      (when (= (list-ref (list-ref grid i) j) 1)\n        (define temp '())\n        (when (> i 0) (set! temp (cons (list-ref (list-ref grid (- i 1)) j) temp)))\n        (when (> j 0) (set! temp (cons (list-ref (list-ref grid i) (- j 1)) temp)))\n        (when (< i (- n 1)) (set! temp (cons (list-ref (list-ref grid (+ i 1)) j) temp)))\n        (when (< j (- n 1)) (set! temp (cons (list-ref (list-ref grid i) (+ j 1)) temp)))\n        (set! val (apply min temp)))))\n  (define ans '())\n  (for ([i (in-range k)])\n    (if (even? i)\n        (set! ans (append ans (list 1)))\n        (set! ans (append ans (list val)))))\n  ans)\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function `minPath` that takes two arguments, a `grid` and an integer `k`. The function returns a list of integers `ans`. \n\nThe `grid` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the grid. Each element of the inner list is either 0 or 1. The `1`s represent obstacles in the grid. The `k` is an integer that determines the length of the output list `ans`.\n\nThe first line of the code specifies the language being used, which is Racket.\n\nThe second line of the code is a comment that explains what the code does.\n\nThe third line of the code defines a function `minPath` that takes two arguments, `grid` and `k`.\n\nThe fourth line of the code defines a variable `n` that is equal to the length of the `grid`.\n\nThe fifth line of the code defines a variable `val` that is equal to `n*n + 1`.\n\nThe sixth line of the code starts a for loop that iterates over the range of `n`. The variable `i` takes on the values of the range of `n`. \n\nThe seventh line of the code starts another for loop that iterates over the range of `n`. The variable `j` takes on the values of the range of `n`.\n\nThe eighth line of the code checks if the element at the `i`th row and `j`th column of the `grid` is equal to `1`.\n\nThe ninth line of the code defines a variable `temp` that is an empty list.\n\nThe tenth line of the code checks if `i` is greater than `0`. If it is, it adds the element at the `i-1`th row and `j`th column of the `grid` to the beginning of the `temp` list.\n\nThe eleventh line of the code checks if `j` is greater than `0`. If it is, it adds the element at the `i`th row and `j-1`th column of the `grid` to the beginning of the `temp` list.\n\nThe twelfth line of the code checks if `i` is less than `n-1`. If it is, it adds the element at the `i+1`th row and `j`th column of the `grid` to the beginning of the `temp` list.\n\nThe thirteenth line of the code checks if `j` is less than `n-1`. If it is, it adds the element at the `i`th row and `j+1`th column of the `grid` to the beginning of the `temp` list.\n\nThe fourteenth line of the code applies the `min` function to the `temp` list and sets the result to the `val` variable.\n\nThe fifteenth line of the code defines a variable `ans` that is an empty list.\n\nThe sixteenth line of the code starts a for loop that iterates over the range of `k`. The variable `i` takes on the values of the range of `k`.\n\nThe seventeenth line of the code checks if `i` is even. If it is, it appends `1` to the `ans` list.\n\nThe eighteenth line of the code checks if `i` is odd. If it is, it appends the value of `val` to the `ans` list.\n\nThe nineteenth line of the code returns the `ans` list.<|im_end|>\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction minPath(grid::Vector{Vector{Int64}}, k::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_100_make_a_pile", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function make_a_pile(n::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_100_make_a_pile.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = make_a_pile;\n\t@test(candidate(3) == [3, 5, 7])\n\t@test(candidate(4) == [4, 6, 8, 10])\n\t@test(candidate(5) == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13])\n\t@test(candidate(6) == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16])\n\t@test(candidate(8) == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22])\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `for/list` macro is a shorthand for the `for` loop that returns a list of the values produced by the loop. \n\nThe `for/list` macro takes two arguments: a list of bindings and a body. The bindings are used to bind variables to values that are used in the body of the loop. The body is a list of expressions that are evaluated for each iteration of the loop. \n\nIn this case, the binding is `([i n])`, which binds the variable `i` to each value in the range `[0, n-1]`. The body of the loop is `(+ n (* 2 i))`, which adds `n` to twice the value of `i`. \n\nThus, the function returns a list of integers that are generated by adding `n` to twice each value in the range `[0, n-1]`. \n\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction make_a_pile(n::Int64)::Vector{Int64}\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_31_is_prime", "language": "jl", "prompt": "function is_prime(n::Int64)::Bool\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_31_is_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "end\n\nusing Test\n\n@testset begin\n\ncandidate = is_prime;\n\t@test(candidate(6) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(101) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(11) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(13441) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(61) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(4) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(1) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(5) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(11) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(17) == true)\n\t@test(candidate(85) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(77) == false)\n\t@test(candidate(255379) == false)\nend\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n#", "\nend"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.
