The function is called `correctBracketing` and takes a single argument, a string of brackets. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are balanced or not.\n\nThe function works by iterating over each character in the string of brackets. If the character is an opening bracket, the depth of the bracketing is incremented. If the character is a closing bracket, the depth is decremented. If the depth ever becomes negative, this means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `false`. If the depth is zero at the end of the iteration, this means that all opening brackets have been closed, so the function returns `true`.\n\nThe function is implemented in Java and uses several built-in Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also uses the Java 8 `Stream` API to process the input string of brackets. To rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the Java-specific libraries with their C++ equivalents and rewrite the code to use C++ syntax. Here is an example implementation of the same function in C++:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"

The method takes two arguments, both of type `long`, and returns a `float` value. The method calculates the area of a triangle given the length of one of its sides (`a`) and the height of the triangle (`h`).\n\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is `(base * height) / 2`. In this case, `a` is the base and `h` is the height. The method multiplies `a` and `h`, divides the result by 2, and returns the result as a `float`.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various Java libraries that are used in the implementation of the `triangleArea` method. These libraries include `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. \n\nThe `java.util.*` library provides various utility classes and methods, such as the `Scanner` class for reading user input and the `ArrayList` class for storing collections of objects.\n\nThe `java.lang.reflect.*` library provides classes and interfaces for working with reflection, which is a mechanism for examining and modifying the behavior of classes, interfaces, and objects at runtime.\n\nThe `org.javatuples.*` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered collections of elements of different types.\n\nThe `java.security.*` library provides classes and interfaces for working with security-related functionality, such as encryption and decryption.\n\nThe `java.math.*` library provides classes and methods for working with mathematical operations, such as calculating square roots and generating random numbers.\n\nThe `java.io.*` library provides classes and methods for working with input and output streams, such as reading and writing files.\n\nThe `Problem` class does not contain a `main` method, so it cannot be run as a standalone program. It is intended to be used as a utility class that provides the `triangleArea` method for other programs to use. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long h) {\n"

Otherwise, it creates a copy of the ArrayList and sorts it in ascending order.

This new ArrayList represents the original ArrayList with the minimum value moved to the beginning.\n\nThe function then iterates through the original ArrayList and the sorted ArrayList in parallel, checking if the elements at each index are equal.

If `n` has no odd digits, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function first initializes two variables: `product` and `oddCount`. `product` is initialized to 1 because it will be used to multiply the odd digits together, and multiplying by 1 has no effect. `oddCount` is initialized to 0 because it will be used to count the number of odd digits in `n`.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`. For each character, it checks if it is an odd digit by using the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the digit is divisible by 2. If the digit is odd, it multiplies `product` by the digit and increments `oddCount`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `product` if `oddCount` is greater than 0 (meaning there was at least one odd digit), and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong digits(long n) {\n"

The function takes an ArrayList of Longs and returns an ArrayList of Longs. \n\nThe function is called `orderByPoints` and takes an ArrayList of Longs called `nums` as input. \n\nThe function returns the sorted ArrayList of Longs. The sorting is done using the `sorted` method of the `Stream` class. The `sorted` method takes a `Comparator` as input. The `Comparator` is implemented as a lambda function that compares the sum of the digits of two numbers. The `Long.compare` method is used to compare the sums of the digits of the two numbers.\n\nThe `digitsSum` method is a private method that takes a `long` as input and returns a `long`. The method calculates the sum of the digits of the input number. \n\nThe method first checks if the input number is negative. If it is, it multiplies the sum of the digits by -1. \n\nThe method then converts the input number to a `String` and creates an array of `longs` from the digits of the `String`. The `charAt` method of the `String` class is used to get the character at each index of the `String`. The character is then converted to a `long` by subtracting the ASCII value of `'0'`. \n\nThe first digit of the array is then multiplied by `neg` to account for the negative sign of the input number. \n\nThe method then returns the sum of the digits using the `sum` method of the `Arrays` class. \n\nThe code imports several packages including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These packages are not used in the code and can be removed. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> order_by_points(std::vector<long> nums) {\n"

A string is happy if it does not contain any three consecutive identical characters.

The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the input string is happy or not.\n\nThe method first checks if the length of the input string is less than 3. If the length is less than 3, the method returns `false`, because a string with less than 3 characters cannot contain three consecutive identical characters.\n\nIf the length of the input string is greater than or equal to 3, the method iterates over the characters of the string using a `for` loop. The loop starts at the first character of the string and ends at the third-to-last character of the string. For each character in the loop, the method checks if the character is equal to the next character or the character after that. If any three consecutive characters are equal, the method returns `false`, because the string is not happy.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any three consecutive identical characters, the method returns `true`, indicating that the string is happy.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_happy(std::string s) {\n"

If `shift` is greater than the length of `s`, the function returns the reverse of `s`. Otherwise, the function returns a substring of `s` that starts at the index `s.length() - shift` and ends at the end of the string, concatenated with a substring of `s` that starts at the beginning of the string and ends at the index `s.length() - shift`. \n\nThe `substring` method of the `String` class is used to extract the appropriate substrings. The `StringBuilder` class is used to reverse the string when `shift` is greater than the length of `s`. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also uses the `stream` method of the `Stream` class to create a stream of integers. However, none of these libraries or methods are actually used in the `circularShift` function, so they can be removed. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string circular_shift(long x, long shift) {\n"

These libraries provide various utilities for working with arrays, tuples, security, and input/output.\n\nThe function then defines a static method `maxFill` that takes in an `ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>>` and a `long` as input and returns a `long`. The function uses Java 8 streams to calculate the maximum number of times the 2D array can be filled with the given capacity.\n\nThe `grid` parameter is an `ArrayList` of `ArrayLists` of `Longs`. The `capacity` parameter is a `long` that represents the maximum capacity of the 2D array.\n\nThe `grid.stream()` method returns a stream of `ArrayList<Long>` objects. The `mapToLong` method is then called on each `ArrayList<Long>` object in the stream. The `mapToLong` method maps each `Long` object in the `ArrayList<Long>` to a `long` value. The `sum` method is then called on the resulting `LongStream` to calculate the sum of all the `long` values in the `ArrayList<Long>`.\n\nThe `Math.ceil` method is then called on the sum of each `ArrayList<Long>` divided by the `capacity` parameter. This calculates the number of times the `ArrayList<Long>` can be filled with the given capacity, rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\nThe `sum` method is then called on the resulting `LongStream` to calculate the sum of all the calculated values for each `ArrayList<Long>` in the `grid` parameter.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of all the calculated values, which represents the maximum number of times the 2D array can be filled with the given capacity.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong max_fill(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long capacity) {\n"

The function is called `hasCloseElements` and takes two arguments: an ArrayList of floats called `numbers` and a float called `threshold`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any two elements in the array that are closer than the threshold.\n\nThe function uses a nested loop to compare each element in the array with every other element in the array. The outer loop iterates over each element in the array, while the inner loop iterates over each element in the array again. The two loops are nested, so for each element in the outer loop, the inner loop will iterate over every element in the array.\n\nThe if statement inside the inner loop checks if the two elements being compared are not the same element (i.e., if `i` is not equal to `j`). If the two elements are not the same, the distance between them is calculated using the `Math.abs` function, which returns the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers. If the distance between the two elements is less than the threshold, the function returns `true`, indicating that there are two elements in the array that are closer than the threshold.\n\nIf the function has compared every element in the array and has not found any two elements that are closer than the threshold, it returns `false`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n"

The function returns `y` if `n` is equal to 1 or if `n` is not a prime number. Otherwise, the function returns `x`.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `y`. Otherwise, the function checks if `n` is a prime number. It does this by iterating over all numbers from 2 to `n - 1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns `y`. If `n` is not divisible by any number in this range, the function returns `x`.\n\nThe function is written in Java and uses several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also uses Java 8 features, including `java.util.stream`. The function could be rewritten in C++ using similar logic and libraries. However, the syntax and libraries used in C++ would be different. For example, C++ does not have a built-in library for tuples like `org.javatuples`, so a different library or data structure would need to be used. Additionally, C++ does not have built-in support for Java 8 features like `java.util.stream`, so a different approach would need to be taken to implement the same logic. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong x_or_y(long n, long x, long y) {\n"

The function counts the number of elements in the ArrayList that are greater than 10 and have an odd first and last digit.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable called `count` to 0. It then iterates over each element in the ArrayList using a for-each loop. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than 10. If it is, it checks if the first and last digits of the element are odd. It does this by dividing the element by 10 raised to the power of the number of digits minus one, and then taking the remainder when divided by 10. If both the first and last digits are odd, it increments the `count` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `count` variable.\n\nThe `isOdd` function is a helper function that takes a long integer and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is odd or not. It does this by checking if the remainder when the integer is divided by 2 is equal to 1. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong specialFilter(std::vector<long> nums) {\n"

The class has a single static method named `parseMusic` which takes a single argument of type `String`. The method returns an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects.\n\nThe `parseMusic` method starts by creating a `HashMap` object named `note_map`. The `HashMap` maps `String` keys to `Long` values. The `HashMap` is initialized with three key-value pairs. The keys are the `String` values `\"o\"`, `\"o|\"`, and `\".|\"`. The corresponding values are `Long` values `4L`, `2L`, and `1L`, respectively.\n\nThe `parseMusic` method then splits the input `String` on whitespace characters using the `split` method of the `String` class. The resulting array of `String` objects is then converted to a `Stream` of `String` objects using the `Arrays.stream` method. The `Stream` is then filtered to remove any empty `String` objects using the `filter` method. The `Stream` is then mapped to a `Stream` of `Long` objects using a lambda expression that looks up the corresponding value in the `note_map` `HashMap` for each `String` object in the `Stream`. The `Stream` of `Long` objects is then collected into an `ArrayList` using the `collect` method of the `Stream` class.\n\nThe resulting `ArrayList` of `Long` objects is then returned by the `parseMusic` method.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> parse_music(std::string music_string) {\n"

The function calculates the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in the input string. If the input string is empty, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function is defined in a class called `Problem`. The class imports several packages including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These packages provide various utility classes and functions that are used in the implementation of the `digitSum` function.\n\nThe `digitSum` function takes a single parameter `s` of type `String`. The function first checks if the input string is empty using the `equals` method of the `String` class. If the input string is empty, the function returns 0.\n\nIf the input string is not empty, the function uses the `chars` method of the `String` class to convert the input string to a stream of integers representing the ASCII values of each character in the string. The `filter` method of the `Stream` class is then used to select only the uppercase characters in the stream. The `sum` method of the `IntStream` class is then used to calculate the sum of the selected ASCII values, which is returned as the result of the function.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong digitSum(std::string s) {\n"

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. \n\nThe program defines a class called `Problem`. The class has a single method called `fib` that takes a long integer `n` as an argument and returns a long integer. The `fib` method is a recursive function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 0 or 1. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. If `n` is neither 0 nor 1, the function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence by recursively calling the `fib` function with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adding the results together. \n\nThe program imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file. The `java.util` library provides utility classes for working with collections, such as arrays and lists. The `java.lang.reflect` library provides classes for working with reflection, which is a mechanism for examining and modifying the behavior of a program at runtime. The `org.javatuples` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered lists of elements of different types. The `java.security` library provides classes for working with security-related functionality, such as encryption and digital signatures. The `java.math` library provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io` library provides classes for working with input and output streams. The `java.util.stream` library provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. \n\nThe `Problem` class does not have a `main` method, so it cannot be run directly. It is intended to be used as a library that can be imported into other Java programs. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib(long n) {\n"

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming problem that is often used as a test for basic programming skills. The problem is as follows:\n\nWrite a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\".\n\nThe code is written in Java and uses several Java libraries. The first line imports the java.util package, which contains the ArrayList class that is used later in the code. The second line imports the java.lang.reflect package, which is not used in the code. The third line imports the org.javatuples package, which is also not used in the code. The fourth line imports the java.security package, which is used to generate secure random numbers. The fifth line imports the java.math package, which is used to perform mathematical operations. The sixth line imports the java.io package, which is used to perform input and output operations. The seventh line imports the java.util.stream package, which is used to perform stream operations.\n\nThe code defines a class called Problem, which contains a single static method called fizzBuzz. The method takes a long integer n as an argument and returns a long integer. The method creates an empty ArrayList called ns. It then loops through the numbers from 0 to n-1 and checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13. If the number is divisible by either 11 or 13, it is added to the ns ArrayList.\n\nThe method then creates a stream from the ns ArrayList and maps each element to a string using the String.valueOf method. It then flattens the resulting stream of strings into a stream of characters using the flatMapToInt method. It then filters the resulting stream of characters to only include the character '7' and counts the number of occurrences of '7' using the count method. The resulting count is returned as the output of the method. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fizz_buzz(long n) {\n"

It then calculates the number of uppercase letters in `strong` and subtracts the number of lowercase letters in `strong`. This value is stored in a variable called `myVal`. \n\nThe function then iterates over the `extensions` ArrayList using a for-each loop. For each element `s` in `extensions`, it calculates the number of uppercase letters in `s` and subtracts the number of lowercase letters in `s`. This value is stored in a variable called `val`. \n\nIf `val` is greater than `myVal`, then `strong` is set to `s` and `myVal` is set to `val`. \n\nFinally, the function returns a string that concatenates `class_name`, a period, and `strong`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string Strongest_Extension(std::string class_name, std::vector<std::string> extensions) {\n"

The function is called `findClosestElements` and takes an `ArrayList<Float>` as input. The function returns a `Pair<Float, Float>` which represents the closest pair of elements in the input array.\n\nThe function first initializes two variables `closestPair` and `distance` to `null`. These variables will be used to store the closest pair of elements and the distance between them respectively.\n\nThe function then loops through each element in the input array using a `for` loop. For each element, it loops through the array again using another `for` loop. This nested loop is used to compare each element with every other element in the array.\n\nIf the two elements being compared are not the same element (i.e. they have different indices), the function calculates the absolute difference between the two elements using the `Math.abs` function. If the `distance` variable is `null` or the new distance is less than the current `distance`, the `distance` variable is updated to the new distance and the `closestPair` variable is updated to a new `Pair<Float, Float>` object that represents the two closest elements.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `closestPair` variable which contains the closest pair of elements in the input array.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<float, float> find_closest_elements(std::vector<float> numbers) {\n"

If the month is valid, the function checks if the day is valid for that month. If the month has 31 days, the day must be between 1 and 31. If the month has 30 days, the day must be between 1 and 30. If the month is February, the day must be between 1 and 29.\n\nIf the month and day are both valid, the function returns true.

The `java.util.*` package provides utility classes for working with data structures such as lists, maps, and sets. The `java.lang.reflect.*` package provides classes for working with reflection, which is a mechanism for inspecting and modifying the behavior of classes, interfaces, and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` package provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered lists of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` package provides classes for working with security-related functionality such as encryption and decryption.

The method takes two long integers as input and returns their sum. The method is implemented using the `+` operator, which adds the two input values together.\n\nThe fourth line of the code closes the `add` method.\n\nThe fifth line of the code closes the `Problem` class.\n\nThe code does not have any main method, which means that it cannot be executed directly.

The function is called `largestDivisor` and takes a single argument, `n`, which is the number to find the largest divisor of.\n\nThe function iterates over all numbers from `n-1` down to `1`. For each number, `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, then `i` is the largest divisor of `n`, so the function returns `i`.\n\nIf the function has iterated over all numbers from `n-1` down to `1` and has not found a divisor, then `1` is the largest divisor of `n`, so the function returns `1`.\n\nThe function is declared as `public static`, which means that it can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the `Problem` class. The `long` return type indicates that the function returns a 64-bit integer.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various Java libraries that are used in the function. The `java.util.*` library provides various utility classes and data structures, such as `List` and `Map`. The `java.lang.reflect.*` library provides classes for working with Java reflection, which allows programs to inspect and modify the behavior of classes and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered collections of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` library provides classes for working with security-related functionality, such as encryption and digital signatures. The `java.math.*` library provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io.*` library provides classes for working with input and output streams. The `java.util.stream.*` library provides classes for working with streams of data, which can be processed in parallel.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The class contains a single method, `largestDivisor`, which is declared as `public static`. This means that the method can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the `Problem` class, and that the method does not depend on any instance variables of the class.\n\nThe `Problem` class does not have a constructor, which means that instances of the class cannot be created. The class is used only to group related methods and data together.\n\nThe `long` return type of the `largestDivisor` method indicates that the method returns a 64-bit integer. The method takes a single argument, `n`, which is also a 64-bit integer.\n\nThe method uses a `for` loop to iterate over all numbers from `n-1` down to `1`. The loop variable is declared as `long i`, which means that it is a 64-bit integer. The loop condition is `i >= 1`, which means that the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`. The loop variable is decremented by `1` at the end of each iteration using the `--` operator.\n\nInside the loop, the method checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the `%` operator. If the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is `0`, then `i` is a divisor of `n`, so the method returns `i`.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding a divisor, then `1` is the largest divisor of `n`, so the method returns `1`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong largest_divisor(long n) {\n"

The function is implemented in Java.\n\nThe function takes a string of numbers as input. The numbers are separated by spaces. The function first creates a map called `valueMap` that maps the English names of the numbers to their integer values. The map is implemented as a `HashMap` object. The `HashMap` object is created using an anonymous class that extends the `HashMap` class. The `put` method of the `HashMap` object is used to add the English names of the numbers and their integer values to the map.\n\nThe function then splits the input string into an array of strings using the `split` method of the `String` class. The `split` method takes a regular expression as an argument and returns an array of strings that are separated by the regular expression. In this case, the regular expression is a space character.\n\nThe function then filters out any empty strings from the array using the `filter` method of the `Stream` class. The `filter` method takes a predicate as an argument and returns a new stream that contains only the elements that satisfy the predicate. In this case, the predicate is a lambda expression that checks if the string is not empty.\n\nThe function then sorts the remaining strings using the `sorted` method of the `Stream` class. The `sorted` method takes a comparator as an argument and returns a new stream that contains the elements sorted according to the comparator. In this case, the comparator is a lambda expression that compares the integer values of the English names of the numbers using the `valueMap` map.\n\nThe function then converts the sorted stream of strings back into a string using the `toArray` method of the `Stream` class. The `toArray` method takes a generator as an argument and returns an array of objects that are generated by the generator. In this case, the generator is a lambda expression that converts each string in the stream to an object of type `String`.\n\nFinally, the function joins the array of strings into a single string using the `join` method of the `String` class. The `join` method takes a delimiter and an array of strings as arguments and returns a single string that contains the strings separated by the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space character. The function then returns the resulting string.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string sort_numbers(std::string numbers) {\n"

The method is called `belowThreshold` and takes in two arguments: an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects called `l`, and a `long` value called `t`.

The loop uses a \"for-each\" loop syntax, which is a shorthand way of iterating over all the elements in a collection. The loop variable `e` is of type `long` and is assigned the value of each element in the `ArrayList` in turn.\n\nInside the loop, the method checks if the current element `e` is greater than or equal to the threshold value `t`.

It also uses the `ArrayList` class and the `Collections` class from the `java.util` package, as well as the `subList` method from the `ArrayList` class.\n\nThe code also defines a `Problem` class, but this class is not used in the implementation of the `maximum` function. It is possible that the `Problem` class is used elsewhere in the program, but this is not clear from the code provided. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> maximum(std::vector<long> arr, long k) {\n"

The function separates the input string into groups of parentheses, where each group is a string that starts with an opening parenthesis and ends with a closing parenthesis. \n\nThe function starts by initializing an empty ArrayList called `result` that will store the separated groups of parentheses. It also initializes an empty ArrayList called `current_string` that will store the characters of the current group being processed. Finally, it initializes an integer variable called `current_depth` that will keep track of the depth of the current group being processed.\n\nThe function then iterates through each character of the input string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if it is an opening parenthesis. If it is, it increments the `current_depth` variable and adds the character to the `current_string` ArrayList. If it is a closing parenthesis, it decrements the `current_depth` variable and adds the character to the `current_string` ArrayList.\n\nIf the `current_depth` variable becomes zero, it means that the current group being processed has ended. The function then creates a new StringBuilder object called `sb` and appends each character in the `current_string` ArrayList to it. It then converts the StringBuilder object to a string and adds it to the `result` ArrayList. Finally, it clears the `current_string` ArrayList to prepare for the next group.\n\nAfter iterating through the entire input string, the function returns the `result` ArrayList containing the separated groups of parentheses.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> separate_paren_groups(std::string paren_string) {\n"

For example, 8 is a power of 2 because 2^3 = 8. \n\nThe function is called `isSimplePower` and takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, both of type `long`. The function returns a boolean value, `true` if `x` is a power of `n`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then the function returns `true` if `x` is also equal to 1, and `false` otherwise. This is because any number raised to the power of 1 is equal to itself.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, then the function initializes a variable called `power` to 1. The function then enters a loop that continues as long as `power` is less than `x`. In each iteration of the loop, `power` is multiplied by `n`. This continues until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `power` is equal to `x`, and `false` otherwise. This is because if `x` is a power of `n`, then there exists some integer `k` such that `n^k = x`. The loop in the function calculates `n^k` until it is greater than or equal to `x`. If `power` is equal to `x`, then `n^k = x`, and so `x` is a power of `n`. If `power` is greater than `x`, then `x` is not a power of `n`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_simple_power(long x, long n) {\n"

Swaps the case of the input string using the `swapCase` method.\n4. Initializes a string builder called `sb`.\n5.

The function sorts the input list in ascending order, then creates a new list that contains only the strings with even length. The new list is then sorted in ascending order of length and returned.\n\nThe first line of the code imports several Java libraries that will be used in the function. The `java.util` library provides utility classes for working with collections, such as ArrayLists. The `java.lang.reflect` library provides classes for working with reflection, which is a way to inspect and manipulate the structure of classes at runtime. The `org.javatuples` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered lists of elements of different types. The `java.security` library provides classes for working with security, such as generating random numbers. The `java.math` library provides classes for working with mathematical operations, such as computing the square root of a number. The `java.io` library provides classes for working with input and output, such as reading and writing files. The `java.util.stream` library provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.\n\nThe second line of the code defines a class called `Problem`. The class has a single static method called `sortedListSum` that takes an ArrayList of strings as input and returns another ArrayList of strings.\n\nThe third line of the code defines the `sortedListSum` method. The method first sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sort` method of the ArrayList class. The `null` argument passed to the `sort` method indicates that the default ordering should be used, which is lexicographic ordering for strings.\n\nThe fourth line of the code creates a new ArrayList called `new_lst`.\n\nThe fifth line of the code starts a loop that iterates over each string `i` in the input list.\n\nThe sixth line of the code checks if the length of the string `i` is even using the modulo operator `%`. If the length is even, the string is added to the `new_lst` list using the `add` method of the ArrayList class.\n\nThe seventh line of the code sorts the `new_lst` list in ascending order of length using a lambda expression. The lambda expression `(a, b) -> a.length() - b.length()` defines a function that takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and returns the difference between their lengths. The `sort` method of the ArrayList class uses this function to compare the elements of the list and sort them accordingly.\n\nThe eighth line of the code returns the `new_lst` list.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> sorted_list_sum(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

The input string is expected to be a comma-separated list of words. The function replaces commas with spaces and then splits the string into an array of strings using whitespace as a delimiter.\n\nThe function is defined in a class called `Problem`. The class imports several packages, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These packages provide various utility classes and methods for working with data structures, reflection, tuples, security, math, and input/output.\n\nThe function is called `wordsString` and takes a single argument, a string `s`. The function returns an `ArrayList` of strings.\n\nThe function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty `ArrayList`.\n\nIf the input string is not empty, the function creates a new `ArrayList` called `sList`. The function then iterates over each character in the input string using a for-each loop. If the character is a comma, the function adds a space to `sList`. Otherwise, the function adds the character as a string to `sList`.\n\nThe function then joins all the strings in `sList` into a single string using the `String.join` method. The delimiter used is an empty string, so the resulting string has no spaces between the words. The function then splits the joined string into an array of strings using whitespace as a delimiter. The resulting array is returned as an `ArrayList`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> words_string(std::string s) {\n"

The function counts the number of palindromic numbers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and returns the count of even and odd palindromes.\n\nThe function `evenOddPalindrome` starts by initializing two long integers `evenPalindromeCount` and `oddPalindromeCount` to 0. It then loops through all the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and for each number, it checks whether it is a palindrome and whether it is even or odd. If the number is a palindrome and odd, it increments `oddPalindromeCount`. If the number is a palindrome and even, it increments `evenPalindromeCount`.\n\nThe function `isPalindrome` is a helper function that takes a long integer `n` and returns `true` if `n` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. It does this by converting `n` to a string, reversing the string, and comparing the reversed string to the original string. If the two strings are equal, then `n` is a palindrome.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also uses a Java stream to simplify the loop in `evenOddPalindrome`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n"

The function is called `triangleArea` and takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nThe first line of the function calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle, `s`, which is half the sum of the lengths of the three sides.\n\nThe second line calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`. The `Math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of the expression, and the result is cast to a `float`.\n\nThe third line checks if the triangle is degenerate (i.e., if it is not a valid triangle). A triangle is degenerate if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is less than or equal to the length of the third side. If the triangle is degenerate, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the area is rounded to two decimal places using `Math.round(area * 100.0f) / 100.0f` and returned.\n\nThe rest of the code is not relevant to the implementation of the `triangleArea` function and can be ignored. It includes imports for various Java libraries, a class definition, and a `main` function that is not used. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long b, long c) {\n"

The triangular numbers are defined as the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, the first 5 triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15.\n\nThe function `tri` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number of terms to generate. The function returns an `ArrayList<Long>` containing the first `n` terms of the sequence.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is zero. If `n` is zero, the function returns an `ArrayList<Long>` containing a single element, which is the first term of the sequence (which is always 1).\n\nIf `n` is not zero, the function initializes an `ArrayList<Long>` called `my_tri` with the first two terms of the sequence (which are always 1 and 3). The function then enters a loop that generates the remaining terms of the sequence.\n\nThe loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`. For each value of `i`, the function calculates the `i`th term of the sequence and adds it to the `my_tri` list.\n\nThe calculation of the `i`th term depends on whether `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the `i`th term is simply `i/2 + 1`. If `i` is odd, the `i`th term is calculated as the sum of the previous two terms in the sequence (which are stored in the `my_tri` list) plus a correction term `(i + 3)/2`.\n\nThe function returns the `my_tri` list after the loop has completed.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> tri(long n) {\n"

The function takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns a float value.\n\nThe function first sorts the input list using the `Collections.sort()` method. It then calculates the size of the list and checks if it is odd or even. If the size is odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If the size is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements.\n\nThe `Problem` class is the main class of the program. It contains only one static method, `median()`, which is the implementation of the median function.\n\nThe program imports several Java libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various utilities and functionalities that are used in the program.\n\nThe `java.util.*` library provides the `ArrayList` class, which is used to store the input list of long integers. The `Collections` class, which is also part of the `java.util.*` library, provides the `sort()` method that is used to sort the input list.\n\nThe `java.lang.reflect.*` library provides classes and interfaces for obtaining information about classes and objects at runtime. This library is not used in the program.\n\nThe `org.javatuples.*` library provides classes for creating tuples of various sizes. This library is not used in the program.\n\nThe `java.security.*` library provides classes and interfaces for the security framework of Java. This library is not used in the program.\n\nThe `java.math.*` library provides classes for performing arbitrary-precision arithmetic. This library is not used in the program.\n\nThe `java.io.*` library provides classes for input and output operations. This library is not used in the program.\n\nThe `Stream` class, which is part of the `java.util.stream.*` library, is used in the program to perform stream operations on the input list. However, the stream operations are not used in the implementation of the median function.\n\nOverall, the program is a simple implementation of a function that calculates the median of a list of long integers. It imports several Java libraries, but only uses a few of them. The implementation of the median function is straightforward and can be easily translated to other programming languages, such as C++. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat median(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The function is called `longest` and is defined as a static method of the `Problem` class. The function returns an `Optional<String>` which is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. \n\nThe function first checks if the input ArrayList is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty `Optional`. If the ArrayList is not empty, the function initializes a variable `longest` to the first string in the ArrayList. The function then iterates through the rest of the strings in the ArrayList and compares their lengths to the length of `longest`. If a string is found that is longer than `longest`, the variable `longest` is updated to that string. Once all the strings have been compared, the function returns an `Optional` containing the value of `longest`. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file. The `java.util` library provides utility classes for working with collections, such as ArrayLists. The `java.lang.reflect` library provides classes for working with reflection, which is a way to inspect and modify the behavior of classes at runtime. The `org.javatuples` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are fixed-size collections of elements. The `java.security` library provides classes for working with security-related functionality, such as encryption and decryption. The `java.math` library provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io` library provides classes for working with input and output streams. The `java.util.stream` library provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that finds the longest string in an ArrayList. It does not use any advanced or complex features of Java, and should be relatively easy to translate to C++. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<std::string> longest(std::vector<std::string> strings) {\n"

For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value. \n\nThe function takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns an ArrayList of Longs as output. \n\nThe function is implemented using Java 8 streams. The input ArrayList is sorted using the `sorted` method of the stream. The `sorted` method takes a `Comparator` as argument. The `Comparator` is implemented as a lambda expression that takes two Longs as input and returns an int. \n\nThe lambda expression first calculates the number of ones in the binary representation of the two Longs using the `Long.bitCount` method. The `Math.abs` method is used to handle negative numbers. \n\nIf the number of ones in the binary representation of the two Longs is the same, the lambda expression compares the two Longs using the `Long.compare` method. \n\nIf the number of ones in the binary representation of the two Longs is different, the lambda expression compares the two numbers based on the number of ones in their binary representation using the `Integer.compare` method. \n\nFinally, the sorted stream is collected into a new ArrayList using the `collect` method of the stream. The `Collectors.toCollection` method is used to specify the type of the output ArrayList. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_array(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

A cyclic pattern is a pattern that can be obtained by rotating a string by some number of positions. For example, the string `abcabc` is a cyclic pattern of the string `abc`.\n\nThe function takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `b` is a cyclic pattern of `a`.\n\nThe function first computes the length `l` of the string `b`. It then constructs a new string `pat` by concatenating `b` with itself. This is done to handle the case where the cyclic pattern wraps around the end of the string.\n\nThe function then iterates over all possible substrings of `a` of length `l` and all possible starting positions for `b` in `pat`. For each substring of `a` and starting position of `b`, it checks if the two substrings are equal. If a match is found, the function returns `true`. If no match is found, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function uses several Java libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `cycpatternCheck` function, so they can be safely removed.\n\nHere is the equivalent C++ code:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool cycpattern_check(std::string a, std::string b) {\n"

The function takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns a Long. \n\nThe function works by iterating over the input array and keeping track of the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at the current index. If the sum of the subarray becomes negative, the sum is reset to zero. The maximum sum is updated if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum. \n\nIf the maximum sum is zero, then the function returns the maximum negative value in the input array. Otherwise, the minimum sum is the negative of the maximum sum and is returned.\n\nHere is the line by line explanation:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\n```\nThese are the import statements for the required packages.\n\n```java\nclass Problem {\n```\nThis is the class definition for the Problem class.\n\n```java\npublic static long minSubArraySum(ArrayList<Long> nums) {\n```\nThis is the function definition for the minSubArraySum function. It takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns a Long.\n\n```java\nlong max_sum = 0;\nlong s = 0;\n```\nThese are the variables used to keep track of the maximum sum and the current sum of the subarray.\n\n```java\nfor (long num : nums) {\n    s += -num;\n    if (s < 0) {\n        s = 0;\n    }\n    max_sum = Math.max(s, max_sum);\n}\n```\nThis is the loop that iterates over the input array and calculates the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at the current index. The sum of the subarray is calculated by subtracting the current element from zero and adding it to the current sum. If the sum becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum sum is updated if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum.\n\n```java\nif (max_sum == 0) {\n    max_sum = nums.stream().mapToLong(i -> -i).max().getAsLong();\n}\n```\nThis checks if the maximum sum is zero. If it is, then the function returns the maximum negative value in the input array. This is done by using the Java 8 stream API to find the maximum value in the input array after negating all the elements.\n\n```java\nlong min_sum = -max_sum;\nreturn min_sum;\n```\nThis calculates the minimum sum of the subarray and returns it.

The function is implemented as a static method of the Problem class.\n\nThe function starts by creating an empty HashMap object called dict1, which will be used to store the word frequencies. It then splits the input string into a list of words using the split method of the String class. The split method takes a regular expression as input and returns an array of strings that are separated by the regular expression. In this case, the regular expression is a space character, so the input string is split into words.\n\nThe function then loops through the list of words and counts the frequency of each word using the Collections.frequency method. The frequency of each word is compared to a variable t, which is initially set to zero. If the frequency of a word is greater than t and the word is not an empty string, t is set to the frequency of the word.\n\nAfter the loop, the function checks if t is greater than zero. If it is, the function loops through the list of words again and adds each word with a frequency equal to t to the dict1 dictionary.\n\nFinally, the function returns the dict1 dictionary.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::map<std::string,long> histogram(std::string test) {\n"

The conjecture is that if you take any positive integer n, and apply the following algorithm:\n\n- If n is even, divide it by 2.\n- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n\nThen, no matter what value of n you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.\n\nThe code defines a class called `Problem`. The class has one static method called `getOddCollatz`. The method takes a long integer `n` as input and returns an ArrayList of long integers. The ArrayList contains all the odd numbers that are generated when the Collatz algorithm is applied to `n`.\n\nThe method first creates an empty ArrayList called `oddCollatz`. If `n` is odd, it is added to the ArrayList. The method then enters a loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. In each iteration of the loop, the Collatz algorithm is applied to `n`. If `n` is odd, it is added to the ArrayList. Finally, the ArrayList is sorted in ascending order and returned.\n\nThe code imports several libraries at the beginning of the file. The `java.util` library provides various utility classes and methods, such as ArrayList. The `java.lang.reflect` library provides classes and interfaces for obtaining information about objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples` library provides classes for working with tuples. The `java.security` library provides classes and interfaces for the generation and management of security-related objects. The `java.math` library provides classes for performing arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic. The `java.io` library provides classes for performing input and output operations. The `java.util.stream` library provides classes for processing streams of data. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the code, so they could be removed.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> get_odd_collatz(long n) {\n"

The method is called `derivative` and takes an `ArrayList<Long>` as input. The method returns an `ArrayList<Long>`.\n\nThe method computes the derivative of a polynomial represented by the input array. The derivative of a polynomial is another polynomial whose coefficients are the derivatives of the original polynomial's coefficients. For example, the derivative of the polynomial `3x^2 + 2x + 1` is `6x + 2`.\n\nThe method computes the derivative by iterating over the input array and multiplying each element by its index. The resulting array is the derivative of the input polynomial.\n\nThe method uses the `IntStream` class to iterate over the input array. The `range` method of the `IntStream` class is used to generate a stream of integers from 1 to the size of the input array. The `mapToObj` method of the `IntStream` class is used to apply a lambda function to each element of the stream. The lambda function takes an integer `i` as input and returns the product of `i` and the `i`-th element of the input array. The `collect` method of the `Stream` class is used to collect the resulting stream of long integers into an `ArrayList<Long>`.\n\nThe `Collectors.toCollection` method is used to specify the type of collection to be used to store the resulting elements. In this case, an `ArrayList` is used.\n\nThe `Problem` class imports several other classes and packages, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`.

The function `fibfib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci-Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci-Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- `f(0) = 0`\n- `f(1) = 0`\n- `f(2) = 1`\n- `f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) + f(n - 3)` for `n >= 3`\n\nThe implementation of `fibfib` is recursive. The base cases are `n == 0`, `n == 1`, and `n == 2`, which return `0`, `0`, and `1`, respectively. For `n >= 3`, the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3`, and returns the sum of the three results.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various utility functions and data structures that are used in the implementation of `fibfib`. The `java.util.stream` library is also imported, but is not used in the code.\n\nTo translate this code to C++, we can define a recursive function `fibfib` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci-Fibonacci sequence. The C++ implementation would look like this:\n\n```cpp\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fibfib(long n) {\n"

The `java.util.stream.*` package is used to import classes that provide functionality for processing streams of data.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The class contains a single static method called `chooseNum`. The `static` keyword means that the method belongs to the class and not to any instance of the class. The method takes two long integers as input and returns a long integer.\n\nThe `if` statements in the method are used to check the input values and return the appropriate output. The first `if` statement checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, the method returns -1. The second `if` statement checks if `y` is even. If it is, the method returns `y`. The third `if` statement checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If it is, the method returns -1. If none of the conditions are met, the method returns `y - 1`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong choose_num(long x, long y) {\n"

The function works by iterating through the input string character by character, keeping track of the start and end indices of each sequence of spaces. When a non-space character is encountered, the function checks the length of the previous sequence of spaces and replaces it with underscores or hyphens as appropriate. The function returns the modified string.\n\nHere is a line-by-line breakdown of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\n```\n\nThis block of code imports various Java libraries that are used in the implementation of the `fixSpaces` function.\n\n```java\nclass Problem {\n```\n\nThis line defines a new class called `Problem`.\n\n```java\npublic static String fixSpaces(String text) {\n```\n\nThis line defines a new function called `fixSpaces` that takes a string argument called `text` and returns a string.\n\n```java\nString newText = \"\";\nint i = 0;\nint start = 0, end = 0;\n```\n\nThese lines initialize some variables that will be used in the function. `newText` is an empty string that will be used to build the modified string. `i` is an index variable that will be used to iterate through the input string. `start` and `end` are indices that will be used to keep track of the start and end of each sequence of spaces.\n\n```java\nwhile (i < text.length()) {\n```\n\nThis line starts a while loop that will iterate through the input string character by character.\n\n```java\nif (text.charAt(i) == ' ') {\n    end++;\n} else {\n```\n\nThis block of code checks if the current character is a space. If it is, `end` is incremented to include the current space in the current sequence of spaces. If the current character is not a space, the code inside the `else` block is executed.\n\n```java\nif (end - start > 2) {\n    newText += \"-\"+text.charAt(i);\n} else if (end - start > 0) {\n    newText += \"_\".repeat(end - start)+text.charAt(i);\n} else {\n    newText += text.charAt(i);\n}\nstart = i+1; end = i+1;\n```\n\nThis block of code checks the length of the previous sequence of spaces (i.e. the sequence between `start` and `end-1`). If the sequence is longer than 2, a hyphen is added to `newText` followed by the current non-space character. If the sequence is between 1 and 2 characters long, underscores are added to `newText` followed by the current non-space character. If the sequence is 0 characters long, the current non-space character is simply added to `newText`. Finally, `start` and `end` are updated to reflect the start of the next sequence of spaces.\n\n```java\ni++;\n}\n```\n\nThis line increments the index variable `i` to move to the next character in the input string.\n\n```java\nif (end - start > 2) {\n    newText += \"-\";\n} else if (end - start > 0) {\n    newText += \"_\";\n}\n```\n\nThis block of code handles the case where the input string ends with a sequence of spaces. If the sequence is longer than 2, a hyphen is added to `newText`. If the sequence is between 1 and 2\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string fix_spaces(std::string text) {\n"

The function is named `compare`.\n\nThe function `compare` is defined as `public static ArrayList<Long> compare(ArrayList<Long> game, ArrayList<Long> guess)`. The `public` keyword means that the function is accessible from other classes, the `static` keyword means that the function can be called without creating an instance of the class, and the `ArrayList<Long>` specifies the type of the return value.\n\nThe body of the function is a single line of code that uses the `IntStream` class to iterate over the indices of the `game` ArrayList. For each index `i`, the `Math.abs` function is called with the difference between the `i`th element of `game` and `guess`. The `collect` method is then called on the resulting `Stream` object to convert it back to an `ArrayList<Long>`.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import classes from other packages. `java.util.*` imports the `ArrayList` and `List` classes, `java.lang.reflect.*` imports the `Method` class, `org.javatuples.*` imports the `Tuple` class, `java.security.*` imports the `SecureRandom` class, `java.math.*` imports the `BigInteger` class, and `java.io.*` imports the `IOException` class. `java.util.stream.*` imports the `IntStream` and `Collectors` classes.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class named `Problem`.

The resulting array is looped over using a for-each loop. The loop variable `s` is a string representing a set of nested parentheses.\n\nThe function then initializes two long variables, `depth` and `max_depth`, to 0.\n\nThe function then loops over each character in the string `s`. For each character, the function checks if it is an opening parenthesis.

If the character is a closing parenthesis, the `depth` variable is decremented by 1.\n\nAfter the loop over the characters in `s` is complete, the function adds the value of `max_depth` to the `result` ArrayList.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` ArrayList.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> parse_nested_parens(std::string paren_string) {\n"

The function is defined as `public static`, which means it can be called from anywhere in the program.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then splits the input string `s` using the space character as a delimiter and iterates over the resulting array of strings using a for-each loop. For each string `i` in the array, it checks if it matches the regular expression `\\\\d+`, which matches one or more digits. If the string matches the regular expression, it converts it to a long integer using the `Long.parseLong` method and adds it to the `sum` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the difference between the input `n` and the `sum` variable.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that are used in the implementation of the `fruitDistribution` function.\n\nThe code also includes a `main` method, but it is not used in the implementation of the `fruitDistribution` function and can be ignored for the purposes of understanding the function.

The function `stringXor` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and returns a string that is the result of the XOR operation between the two input strings. \n\nThe XOR operation is a bitwise operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 or only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. \n\nThe `stringXor` function uses the `IntStream` class to iterate over the indices of the input strings. For each index `i`, it checks if the `i`th character of `a` is equal to the `i`th character of `b`. If they are equal, it appends a \"0\" to the output string, otherwise it appends a \"1\". Finally, it returns the output string.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import necessary classes and packages. `java.util.*` is used to import the `Scanner` class, `java.lang.reflect.*` is used to import the `Method` class, `org.javatuples.*` is used to import the `Tuple` class, `java.security.*` is used to import the `MessageDigest` class, `java.math.*` is used to import the `BigInteger` class, and `java.io.*` is used to import the `File` class. \n\nThe `public static` modifier before the `stringXor` function means that the function can be called from outside the class and that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. \n\nThe `Stream` class is used to perform operations on a sequence of elements. The `IntStream` class is a specialized version of the `Stream` class that works with integer values. The `range` method of the `IntStream` class is used to create a stream of integers from 0 to the length of the input string `a`. The `mapToObj` method is used to apply a function to each element of the stream and return a new stream of objects. In this case, the function checks if the `i`th character of `a` is equal to the `i`th character of `b` and returns a \"0\" if they are equal, or a \"1\" if they are not equal. The `collect` method is used to combine the elements of the stream into a single string, using the `joining` method of the `Collectors` class. \n\nThe `return` keyword is used to return the output string from the `stringXor` function. \n\nOverall, the code is a concise implementation of the XOR operation between two strings using Java's `IntStream` class and the `collect` method of the `Collectors` class. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string string_xor(std::string a, std::string b) {\n"

The class contains a single static method named `strlen` that takes a `String` object as an argument and returns its length as a `long` value.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the implementation of the `Problem` class. The `java.util.*` package is used to import various utility classes, such as the `Scanner` class for reading input from the console. The `java.lang.reflect.*` package is used to provide runtime information about the `Problem` class, such as its methods and fields. The `org.javatuples.*` package is used to provide a tuple data structure that can hold multiple values of different types. The `java.security.*` package is used to provide cryptographic functionality, such as generating random numbers. The `java.math.*` package is used to provide arbitrary-precision arithmetic operations. The `java.io.*` package is used to provide input and output functionality, such as reading and writing files. The `java.util.stream.*` package is used to provide functional-style operations on streams of data.\n\nThe `Problem` class itself is declared with the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces that enclose the class body. The class body contains a single static method named `strlen`, which is declared with the `public static` keywords, followed by the return type (`long`) and the method name (`strlen`). The method takes a single argument of type `String`, which is named `string`.\n\nThe body of the `strlen` method contains a single statement, which is a `return` statement that returns the length of the `string` argument. The `length` method is a built-in method of the `String` class that returns the length of the string as an `int` value. However, since the method is declared to return a `long` value, the `int` value is automatically promoted to a `long` value before being returned.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to create a new class named `Problem` and declare a static method named `strlen` that takes a `std::string` object as an argument and returns its length as a `long` value. You would also need to include the appropriate C++ libraries for input and output, such as `iostream` and `fstream`. The resulting C++ program might look something like this:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong string_length(std::string string) {\n"

The function returns the index of the first element in the array that is smaller than the previous element. If no such element exists, the function returns -1.\n\nThe function takes an ArrayList of Long objects as input. The ArrayList class is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store a list of objects. In this case, the ArrayList is used to store a list of long integers.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable called `ind` to -1. This variable will be used to store the index of the first element in the array that is smaller than the previous element.\n\nThe function then loops through the array using a for loop. The loop starts at index 1 and ends at the last index of the array. The loop checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element. If it is, the index of the current element is stored in the `ind` variable.\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function returns the value of the `ind` variable.\n\nThe code imports several Java packages at the beginning of the file. These packages are used to provide additional functionality to the program. The packages imported are:\n\n- `java.util.*`: Provides utility classes for working with collections, such as ArrayList.\n- `java.lang.reflect.*`: Provides classes for working with reflection, which is a way to inspect and modify the behavior of classes, interfaces, and objects at runtime.\n- `org.javatuples.*`: Provides classes for working with tuples, which are objects that contain a sequence of elements of different types.\n- `java.security.*`: Provides classes for working with security, such as generating cryptographic keys and certificates.\n- `java.math.*`: Provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers.\n- `java.io.*`: Provides classes for working with input and output, such as reading and writing files.\n- `java.util.stream.*`: Provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.\n\nThe `class Problem` defines a public static method called `canArrange`. The `public` keyword means that the method can be accessed from outside the class. The `static` keyword means that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. The method takes an ArrayList of Long objects as input and returns a long integer.\n\nThe `long` keyword is used to define a variable that can hold a 64-bit integer value. The `Long` class is a wrapper class that provides methods for working with long integers as objects.\n\nThe `for` loop is used to iterate over the elements of the array. The loop starts at index 1 because the first element of the array does not have a previous element to compare it to.\n\nThe `if` statement checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element. If it is, the index of the current element is stored in the `ind` variable.\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function returns the value of the `ind` variable. If no element in the array is smaller than the previous element, the function returns -1.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong can_arrange(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

The class imports several libraries including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various utilities for working with data structures, reflection, tuples, security, math, and input/output.\n\nThe `intersperse` function takes two arguments: an `ArrayList` of `Long` integers called `numbers` and a `long` integer called `delimiter`. It returns a new `ArrayList` of `Long` integers called `result`.\n\nThe function first creates an empty `ArrayList` called `result`.\n\nIf the `numbers` array is empty, the function returns the empty `result` array.\n\nOtherwise, the function loops through each element of the `numbers` array except for the last one. For each element, it adds the element to the `result` array, followed by the delimiter.\n\nAfter the loop, the function adds the last element of the `numbers` array to the `result` array.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` array.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> intersperse(std::vector<long> numbers, long delimeter) {\n"

It concatenates the two strings and checks if the resulting string has balanced parentheses by calling the `check` function. If the concatenated string has balanced parentheses, it returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, it concatenates the two strings in reverse order and checks again. If the reversed concatenated string has balanced parentheses, it returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, it returns \"No\".\n\nThe function `check` takes in a string `s` and checks if it has balanced parentheses. It initializes a variable `val` to 0 and iterates through the string. If the current character is an opening parenthesis, `val` is incremented. If the current character is a closing parenthesis, `val` is decremented. If `val` becomes negative at any point, the function returns `false`. If the iteration completes and `val` is 0, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe code imports several packages: `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These packages provide various utility classes and functions that are used in the code.\n\nThe code defines a class `Problem` with two static methods `matchParens` and `check`. The `public` modifier indicates that the methods can be accessed from outside the class. The `static` modifier indicates that the methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.\n\nThe code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the characters of a string. The `for` loop in Java has the following syntax:\n\n```\nfor (initialization; condition; update) {\n    // code to be executed\n}\n```\n\nThe `initialization` statement is executed once before the loop starts. The `condition` is checked before each iteration of the loop. If it is `true`, the loop continues. If it is `false`, the loop terminates. The `update` statement is executed after each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe code uses the `charAt` method of the `String` class to access the character at a specific index of a string. The `if` statement in Java has the following syntax:\n\n```\nif (condition) {\n    // code to be executed if condition is true\n} else {\n    // code to be executed if condition is false\n}\n```\n\nThe `if` statement executes the code inside the block `{}` if the `condition` is `true`. If the `condition` is `false`, the code inside the block `{}` after the `else` keyword is executed.\n\nThe code uses the ternary operator `? :` to return different values based on a condition. The ternary operator in Java has the following syntax:\n\n```\ncondition ? value1 : value2\n```\n\nIf `condition` is `true`, the operator returns `value1`. Otherwise, it returns `value2`.\n\nThe code uses the `ArrayList` class from the `java.util` package to store a list of strings. The `ArrayList` class provides methods to add, remove, and access elements in the list.\n\nThe code uses the `Math` class from the `java.lang` package to perform mathematical operations. The `Math` class provides methods to perform common mathematical operations such as `abs`, `sqrt`, `pow`, and `random`.\n\nThe code uses the `BigInteger` class from the `java.math`\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string match_parens(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

The function returns a `String`.\n\nThe first line of the function counts the number of odd integers in the first list using the `stream()` method of the `ArrayList` class. The `filter()` method is used to select only the odd integers, and the `count()` method is used to count the number of elements in the resulting stream.\n\nThe second line of the function counts the number of even integers in the second list using the same method as above, but with a different filter condition.\n\nThe third line of the function returns \"YES\" if the number of even integers in the second list is greater than or equal to the number of odd integers in the first list, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java classes and packages that are used in the function. The `java.util.*` package is used for various utility classes, such as `ArrayList`. The `java.lang.reflect.*` package is used for reflection, which allows the program to inspect and modify itself at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` package is used for working with tuples, which are ordered collections of elements. The `java.security.*` package is used for security-related classes, such as `SecureRandom`. The `java.math.*` package is used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as `BigInteger`. The `java.io.*` package is used for input and output operations, such as reading and writing files. The `java.util.stream.*` package is used for working with streams of data, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a class called `Problem`. This class contains a single static method called `exchange`, which is the implementation of the function described above. The `public` keyword indicates that the method is accessible from outside the class. The `static` keyword indicates that the method belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class.\n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that performs a basic computation on two lists of integers. The code could be easily translated to C++ by replacing the `ArrayList` class with a C++ container such as `std::vector`, and using the appropriate syntax for counting the number of odd and even integers. The `import` statements would not be needed in C++, as the necessary classes and packages are included in the standard library.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string exchange(std::vector<long> lst1, std::vector<long> lst2) {\n"

The function takes an integer as input and returns a string.\n\nThe function works by iterating through an array of roman numerals and their corresponding values. The array is sorted in descending order. The function then iterates through the array, starting with the largest value and subtracts the value from the input integer as many times as possible. The corresponding roman numeral is then added to the output string that is returned by the function.\n\nFor example, if the input integer is 14, the function will start by subtracting 10 from the input integer, which leaves 4. The roman numeral \"X\" is then added to the output string. The function then subtracts 4 from the input integer, which leaves 0. The roman numeral \"IV\" is then added to the output string. The final output string is \"xiv\", which is the mini roman numeral representation of the input integer 14.\n\nHere is a line-by-line breakdown of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\n```\n\nThese lines import various Java libraries that are used in the code.\n\n```java\nclass Problem {\n```\n\nThis line defines a new class called \"Problem\".\n\n```java\npublic static String intToMiniRoman(long number) {\n```\n\nThis line defines a new public static function called \"intToMiniRoman\" that takes a long integer as input and returns a string.\n\n```java\nlong[] num = {1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 400, 500, 900, 1000};\nString[] sym = {\"I\", \"IV\", \"V\", \"IX\", \"X\", \"XL\", \"L\", \"XC\", \"C\", \"CD\", \"D\", \"CM\", \"M\"};\n```\n\nThese lines define two arrays: \"num\" and \"sym\". The \"num\" array contains the values of the roman numerals, and the \"sym\" array contains the corresponding roman numerals.\n\n```java\nint i = 12;\nString res = \"\";\n```\n\nThese lines define two variables: \"i\" and \"res\". \"i\" is initialized to 12, which is the index of the largest value in the \"num\" array. \"res\" is initialized to an empty string.\n\n```java\nwhile (number > 0) {\n```\n\nThis line starts a while loop that continues as long as the input integer is greater than 0.\n\n```java\nlong div = number / num[i];\nnumber %= num[i];\n```\n\nThese lines calculate the number of times the current roman numeral should be subtracted from the input integer. \"div\" is set to the integer division of the input integer and the current value in the \"num\" array. The input integer is then updated to the remainder of the input integer and the current value in the \"num\" array.\n\n```java\nwhile (div > 0) {\n    res += sym[i];\n    div--;\n}\n```\n\nThese lines add the current roman numeral to the output string \"div\" number of times.\n\n```java\ni--;\n```\n\nThis line decrements the index \"i\" to move to the next smallest value in the \"num\" array.\n\n```java\n}\n```\n\nThis line ends the while loop.\n\n```java\nreturn res.toLowerCase();\n```\n\nThis line returns the output string in lowercase.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string int_to_mini_roman(long number) {\n"

The `public` keyword is used to specify that the class is accessible from other classes.

The `boolean` keyword is used to specify that the method returns a boolean value.\n\nThe `isEqualToSumEven` method takes a single argument of type `long` named `n`. The method returns `true` if the argument is an even number greater than 7, otherwise it returns `false`. The `return` keyword is used to return a value from the method.\n\nThe `n%2 == 0` expression checks if the argument is an even number. The `&&` operator is used to combine the two conditions. The `n > 7` expression checks if the argument is greater than 7.\n\nThe code does not have any side effects and does not modify any external state.

The function takes an ArrayList of long integers as input and returns the sorted ArrayList.\n\nThe function uses the insertion sort algorithm to sort the array. The algorithm works by iterating through the array and comparing each element to the elements before it. If the element is smaller than the previous element, it is swapped with the previous element until it is in the correct position.\n\nThe function sorts the array by sorting every third element starting from the third element. This is because the input array is actually an array of tuples, where each tuple contains three long integers. The function sorts the tuples by the third element of each tuple.\n\nThe function uses the get() and set() methods of the ArrayList class to access and modify the elements of the array. The get() method is used to retrieve the value of an element at a given index, and the set() method is used to set the value of an element at a given index.\n\nThe function uses a while loop to swap elements until the current element is in the correct position. The loop starts at the current element and moves backwards through the array until it reaches the beginning or until the previous element is smaller than the current element.\n\nThe function returns the sorted ArrayList.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_third(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The numerator and denominator of the two fractions are then parsed into integers using the `parseInt` method of the `Integer` class.\n\nThe numerator of the first fraction is then multiplied by the numerator of the second fraction, and the denominator of the first fraction is multiplied by the denominator of the second fraction. The resulting numerator and denominator are then used to check if the fraction represented by `x` is divisible by the fraction represented by `n`.\n\nIf the remainder of the division of the numerator by the denominator is zero, the function returns `true`, indicating that the fraction represented by `x` is divisible by the fraction represented by `n`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various classes and methods used in the implementation of the `simplify` function.

The function is called `solve` and is defined as a static method of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe function first initializes two integer variables, `flg` and `idx`, to 0. It then converts the input string `s` into a character array using the `toCharArray` method of the `String` class. The character array is stored in a new variable called `newStr`.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the input string using a for-each loop. For each character, it checks if it is a letter using the `isLetter` method of the `Character` class. If the character is a letter, it checks if it is uppercase using the `isUpperCase` method of the `Character` class. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase using the `toLowerCase` method of the `Character` class. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase using the `toUpperCase` method of the `Character` class. The converted character is then stored in the `newStr` array at the same index as the original character.\n\nIf the function encounters at least one letter in the input string, it sets the `flg` variable to 1. If it does not encounter any letters, the `flg` variable remains 0.\n\nAfter iterating over all characters in the input string, the function checks the value of the `flg` variable. If it is 0, the function returns the input string reversed using the `reverse` and `toString` methods of the `StringBuilder` class. If it is 1, the function returns the `newStr` array as a string using the `String` constructor that takes a character array as input.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string solve(std::string s) {\n"

This class contains a single static method called `rightAngleTriangle`. The method takes three long integers as arguments and returns a boolean value.\n\nThe third line of the code defines the `rightAngleTriangle` method.

If this condition is true for any of the three sides of the triangle, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe fourth line of the code closes the definition of the `rightAngleTriangle` method.\n\nThe rest of the code is not used in the implementation of the `rightAngleTriangle` method. It imports various classes and packages that are not used in the code. The `java.util.stream` package is imported, but not used. The `java.io` package is imported, but not used.

The function is defined as a static method of a class called `Problem`.\n\nThe function first calls the `stream()` method on the ArrayList, which returns a stream of Float objects. The stream is then filtered using the `filter()` method, which takes a lambda expression as an argument. The lambda expression checks if the current element of the stream is greater than 0, is odd, and is an integer (i.e. has no decimal places). If the lambda expression returns true, the element is included in the filtered stream.\n\nThe filtered stream is then mapped using the `mapToLong()` method, which takes a lambda expression as an argument. The lambda expression calculates the square of the current element and casts it to a long. The resulting stream of longs is then summed using the `sum()` method, which returns the final result.\n\nIn summary, the `doubleTheDifference` function takes an ArrayList of Floats, filters out any elements that are greater than 0, odd, and have no decimal places, squares each remaining element, casts the result to a long, and returns the sum of all the squared elements. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong double_the_difference(std::vector<float> lst) {\n"

The function `greatestCommonDivisor` takes two `long` integers as input and returns their GCD as a `long`. \n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal. At this point, the common value is the GCD. This is because any common divisor of the two numbers must also divide their difference, and the difference is zero when the two numbers are equal.\n\nThe `while` loop in the function implements this algorithm. The loop continues until `b` is zero, which means that `a` is the GCD. In each iteration of the loop, the value of `b` is replaced with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and the value of `a` is replaced with the original value of `b`. This ensures that `a` is always the larger number and `b` is always the smaller number.\n\nThe rest of the code is not used in this implementation and can be ignored. It imports several Java libraries, defines a class called `Problem`, and includes a `main` method that is not used.

If the list is sorted in ascending order, the function returns `true`. \n\nIf the list is not sorted in ascending order, the function checks if the list is sorted in descending order by calling the `sorted()` method with a `Comparator` that sorts in reverse order, and comparing it to the original list using the `equals()` method. If the list is sorted in descending order, the function returns `true`.\n\nIf neither of these conditions are met, the function returns `false`. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import necessary libraries and classes. The `java.util.*` package is used for utility classes such as `ArrayList` and `Comparator`. The `java.lang.reflect.*` package is used for reflection, which allows the program to inspect and modify itself at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` package is used for tuples, which are immutable sequences of elements. The `java.security.*` package is used for security-related classes such as `SecureRandom`. The `java.math.*` package is used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic operations. The `java.io.*` package is used for input and output operations. The `java.util.stream.*` package is used for stream processing, which allows for efficient processing of large data sets. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a class called `Problem`. The `public static` keywords are used to define a public static method called `monotonic`. The method takes an `ArrayList` of `Long` integers as a parameter and returns a `boolean` value. \n\nThe body of the `monotonic` method is enclosed in curly braces `{}`. The first line of the method checks if the input list is sorted in ascending order by calling the `sorted()` method on the list and comparing it to the original list using the `equals()` method. If the list is sorted in ascending order, the method returns `true`. \n\nIf the list is not sorted in ascending order, the method checks if the list is sorted in descending order by calling the `sorted()` method with a `Comparator` that sorts in reverse order, and comparing it to the original list using the `equals()` method. If the list is sorted in descending order, the method returns `true`.\n\nIf neither of these conditions are met, the method returns `false`. \n\nThe `return` keyword is used to return a value from the method. The `true` and `false` values are boolean literals that represent the true and false states, respectively. \n\nThe `ArrayList` class is a part of the `java.util` package and is used to create a dynamic array that can hold objects of any type. The `Long` class is a part of the `java.lang` package and is used to represent a 64-bit signed integer. \n\nThe `equals()` method is a method of the `Object` class that is used to compare two objects for equality. The `sorted()` method is a method of the `Stream` class that is used to sort the elements of a stream in natural order. The `Comparator` interface is used to define a custom ordering of elements. The `stream()` method is a method of the `Collection` interface that is used to create a stream\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool monotonic(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The strings in the output array are the English names of the numbers in the input array, sorted in descending order of the number of digits in the number.\n\nThe function is called `byLength` and takes an argument of type `ArrayList<Long>`. The function returns an `ArrayList<String>`.\n\nThe first line of the function defines an array of strings named `dic` that contains the English names of the digits 1 through 9.\n\nThe second line of the function sorts the input array in descending order and stores the result in a new array named `sortedArr`. This is done using the `stream` method of the `ArrayList` class, which allows us to perform operations on the elements of the array in a functional style. The `sorted` method sorts the elements in descending order using the `Comparator.reverseOrder()` method.\n\nThe third line of the function creates a new empty array named `newArr` of type `ArrayList<String>`.\n\nThe fourth line of the function iterates over the elements of the `sortedArr` array using a `for` loop. For each element, the code checks if it is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If it is, the code adds the corresponding English name of the digit to the `newArr` array using the `add` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `newArr` array.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> by_length(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

The regular expression `\"(?i)[aeiou]\"` is used to match all vowels in a case-insensitive manner. \n\nThe `(?i)` at the beginning of the regular expression is a flag that makes the matching case-insensitive. The `[aeiou]` part of the regular expression matches any of the vowels a, e, i, o, or u. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. The `java.util.*` import statement is used to import the `List` interface and the `java.util.stream.*` import statement is used to import the `Stream` interface.

The `java.io.*` import statement is used to import the `IOException` class.\n\nThe code does not use any instance variables or constructors, so it can be easily translated to C++ as a standalone function.

The function is called `iscube` and takes a single argument of type `long`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input is a perfect cube or not.\n\nThe function first takes the absolute value of the input number using the `Math.abs` function. This is done to ensure that the function works correctly for negative numbers as well.\n\nThe function then calculates the cube root of the absolute value of the input number using the `Math.cbrt` function. The result of this calculation is rounded to the nearest integer using the `Math.round` function. The rounded value is then cubed using the `Math.pow` function with an exponent of 3.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the result of the cubing operation is equal to the absolute value of the input number.

The function removes all characters from the first string that are in the second string, reverses the resulting string and returns a tuple of the resulting string and a boolean indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome.\n\nThe function is implemented as a static method of a class called `Problem`. The method is declared as `public static` so it can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe `Pair` class is imported from the `org.javatuples` package. This class is used to return the tuple of the resulting string and the boolean.\n\nThe `reverseDelete` method takes two string arguments called `s` and `c`. The first line of the method removes all characters from the string `s` that are in the string `c`. This is done using the `chars` method of the `String` class, which returns an `IntStream` of the characters in the string. The `filter` method is then used to remove all characters that are in the string `c`. The `mapToObj` method is used to convert the resulting `IntStream` to a `Stream` of `String` objects. Finally, the `collect` method is used to join the `Stream` of `String` objects into a single `String`.\n\nThe second line of the method creates a `Pair` object with the resulting string and a boolean indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome. This is done using the `Pair.with` method, which takes two arguments and returns a `Pair` object.\n\nThe boolean value is determined by comparing the reversed string to the original string.

The function takes an ArrayList of Floats as input and returns a float.\n\nThe function first calculates the mean of the input list using the Java 8 Stream API. The reduce method is used to sum all the elements of the list, and the size method is used to get the number of elements in the list. The mean is then calculated by dividing the sum by the number of elements.\n\nThe function then calculates the absolute deviation of each element from the mean using the map method of the Stream API. The map method applies the given function to each element of the list and returns a new Stream with the results. In this case, the function is a lambda expression that subtracts the mean from each element and takes the absolute value of the result.\n\nFinally, the mean absolute deviation is calculated by summing the absolute deviations and dividing by the number of elements in the list.\n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the ArrayList with a vector, and use the accumulate function to sum the elements of the vector. You would also need to write a lambda expression to calculate the absolute deviation of each element from the mean.

The function takes a string of brackets as an input and returns a boolean indicating whether the brackets are balanced or not.\n\nThe function is called `correctBracketing` and takes a single argument `brackets` of type `String`.\n\n```java\npublic static boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {\n```\n\nThe function initializes a variable `depth` to 0.\n\n```java\nint depth = 0;\n```\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the input string `brackets`.\n\n```java\nfor (char b : brackets.toCharArray()) {\n```\n\nFor each character, the function checks if it is an opening bracket (`<`). If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented.\n\n```java\nif (b == '<') {\n    depth++;\n}\n```\n\nIf the character is not an opening bracket, it is assumed to be a closing bracket (`>`). In this case, the `depth` variable is decremented.\n\n```java\nelse {\n    depth--;\n}\n```\n\nIf the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `false`.\n\n```java\nif (depth < 0) {\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nIf the function completes the loop without returning `false`, it checks if the `depth` variable is 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns `false`.\n\n```java\nreturn depth == 0;\n}\n```\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"

These objects represent intervals, where the first element of the pair is the start of the interval and the second element is the end of the interval.\n\nThe function first calculates the length of the intersection between the two intervals by finding the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points. If the length is greater than 0 and is a prime number, the function returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThe `isPrime` function is a helper function that checks if a given number is a prime number. It returns `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise. The function checks if the number is 1 or 0 and returns `false` in those cases. If the number is 2, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the number itself (exclusive). If it is, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.\n\nThe code imports several libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various functionalities, such as working with tuples, generating random numbers, and performing cryptographic operations. However, none of these functionalities are used in the `intersection` function or the `isPrime` function.\n\nThe code also defines a `Problem` class, but this class is not used in the `intersection` function or the `isPrime` function. It is unclear what the purpose of this class is. The code also defines a `main` function, but this function is empty and does not do anything. It is unclear why this function is defined. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string intersection(std::tuple<long, long> interval1, std::tuple<long, long> interval2) {\n"

The class has a single public static method called `hexKey` that takes a string as an argument and returns a long.\n\nThe `hexKey` method takes a string `num` as an argument. It initializes a string `primes` with the value \"2357BD\". It then initializes a long variable `total` with the value 0.\n\nThe method then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the `num` string.

If it does, it increments the `total` variable.\n\nFinally, the method returns the `total` variable.\n\nThe purpose of the `hexKey` method is not clear from the code provided, but it appears to be counting the number of characters in the `num` string that are also in the `primes` string.

Create a boolean variable called `switch_` and set it to `true`.\n3. While the input ArrayList `lst` is not empty, do the following:\n    1. If `switch_` is `true`, add the minimum element of `lst` to `res`. Otherwise, add the maximum element of `lst` to `res`.\n    2. Remove the element that was just added to `res` from `lst`.\n    3.

The function is called `howManyTimes` and takes two arguments, both of which are strings. The function returns a long integer that represents the number of times the substring appears in the string.\n\nThe function works by iterating over the string and checking if each substring of the same length as the input substring is equal to the input substring. If it is, the count of the number of times the substring appears is incremented. The function then returns the final count.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries are used to provide additional functionality to the program.\n\nThe code also defines a `Problem` class, which contains the `howManyTimes` function. The `Problem` class is not used in the program, but is included for organizational purposes.\n\nFinally, the code includes a `main` function, which is not used in the program. The `main` function is included for testing purposes, and can be used to test the `howManyTimes` function with different inputs. The `main` function is not necessary for the `howManyTimes` function to work. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong how_many_times(std::string string, std::string substring) {\n"

The function first creates a `HashMap` called `count_digit` that maps each element in the input array to the number of times it appears in the array. The function then checks if any element appears more than twice in the array. If so, it returns `false`. The function then checks if the array is sorted. If not, it returns `false`. If the array is sorted and has at most 2 occurrences of each element, the function returns `true`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_sorted(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The `java.util.*` library provides the `ArrayList` and `Collections` classes, which are used in the program. The `java.lang.reflect.*` library provides classes that are used to obtain information about the program's classes, methods, fields, etc. The `org.javatuples.*` library provides classes for working with tuples. The `java.security.*` library provides classes for implementing security algorithms. The `java.math.*` library provides classes for working with large numbers. The `java.io.*` library provides classes for working with input and output.\n\nThe `Problem` class contains a single static method called `search`. The method takes an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects as input and returns a `long` value. The method is used to find the smallest integer that appears at least as many times as itself in the input list.\n\nThe method starts by creating a new `long` array called `frq`. The length of the array is set to the maximum value in the input list plus one. The `Collections.max` method is used to find the maximum value in the input list. The `intValue` method is used to convert the `Long` object to an `int` value. The `+ 1` is added to ensure that the array is large enough to hold all the values in the input list.\n\nThe `lst.stream().forEach` method is used to iterate over each element in the input list. The lambda expression `i -> frq[i.intValue()]++` is used to increment the value in the `frq` array at the index corresponding to the current element in the input list.\n\nThe `ans` variable is initialized to `-1`. The `for` loop is used to iterate over each element in the `frq` array. The loop starts at index `1` to skip the first element in the array, which is always `0`. The `if` statement checks if the value at the current index is greater than or equal to the index itself. If it is, then the `ans` variable is set to the current index.\n\nFinally, the `ans` variable is returned, which contains the smallest integer that appears at least as many times as itself in the input list.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong search(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward. The function is called `makePalindrome` and takes a string as input. The function returns a string that is a palindrome of the input string.\n\nThe function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty string.\n\nIf the input string is not empty, the function finds the longest suffix of the input string that is also a palindrome. It does this by iterating over the string and checking if the substring from the current index to the end of the string is a palindrome. If it is not, it increments the index and tries again. Once it finds the longest suffix that is a palindrome, it reverses the substring before the suffix and appends it to the original string to create a palindrome.\n\nThe function uses several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, `java.io`, and `java.util.stream`. These libraries provide various utilities and functions that the function uses to implement its logic.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the Java-specific libraries with equivalent C++ libraries and functions. You would also need to translate the Java syntax to C++ syntax. For example, the `StringBuilder` class used in the Java code would need to be replaced with a C++ equivalent, such as `std::string`. Additionally, the `substring` method used in the Java code would need to be replaced with the `substr` method in C++. The `while` loop used in the Java code would remain the same in C++. Overall, the logic of the function would remain the same, but the implementation details would need to be adjusted to work in C++.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string make_palindrome(std::string string) {\n"

The function is called `startsOneEnds` and takes a single argument `n` which is the number of digits that the integer should end with. The function returns a long integer.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns 18 times 10 raised to the power of `n - 2`.\n\nThe function calculates the number of integers that start with 1 and end with `n` digits by first calculating the number of integers that start with 1 and end with `n - 1` digits. This is done by raising 10 to the power of `n - 2`. The function then multiplies this number by 18 to account for the fact that the first digit can be any number from 1 to 9, except 0.\n\nThe function uses the `Math.pow` method to raise 10 to the power of `n - 2`. The `Math.pow` method takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent. The `long` cast is used to convert the result of `Math.pow` to a `long` integer.\n\nThe function uses the `return` keyword to return the result of the calculation.\n\nThe code imports several Java packages at the beginning of the file. The `java.util` package provides utility classes for working with collections, such as `List` and `Map`. The `java.lang.reflect` package provides classes for working with reflection, which is a mechanism for inspecting and modifying the behavior of classes at runtime. The `org.javatuples` package provides classes for working with tuples, which are fixed-size collections of objects. The `java.security` package provides classes for working with security, such as generating secure random numbers. The `java.math` package provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as `BigInteger`. The `java.io` package provides classes for working with input and output, such as `File` and `InputStream`. The `java.util.stream` package provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.\n\nThe code does not use any of the classes or methods from the imported packages, so the imports are unnecessary and can be removed.\n\nThe code also defines a class called `Problem`, but this class is not used and can be removed as well.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) {\n"

It then loops through each character in the input string and checks if the character is an opening or closing square bracket. If the character is an opening square bracket, it adds the index of the character to the `openingBracketIndex` list. If the character is a closing square bracket, it adds the index of the character to the `closingBracketIndex` list.\n\nThe function then reverses the `closingBracketIndex` list and initializes three variables: `cnt`, `i`, and `l`. `cnt` is used to count the number of nested square brackets, `i` is used to keep track of the current index in the `closingBracketIndex` list, and `l` is the length of the `closingBracketIndex` list.\n\nThe function then loops through each index in the `openingBracketIndex` list. For each index, it checks if `i` is less than `l` and if the current index in `openingBracketIndex` is less than the current index in `closingBracketIndex`. If both conditions are true, it increments `cnt` and `i`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `false` otherwise.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_nested(std::string string) {\n"

The problem is not given, but the code is written to solve the problem. The code is written in Java, and it is designed to find the maximum number of triples (i, j, k) such that (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 = 0, where A[i] = i^2 - i + 1 for 1 <= i <= n. \n\nThe code is written in a class called Problem, and it has one static method called getMaxTriples. The method takes in a long integer n, and returns a long integer. \n\nThe first line of the method initializes a long integer called ans to 0. \n\nThe second line of the method initializes an array of long integers called A. The length of the array is n+1, and it is initialized with the values of A[i] for 1 <= i <= n. The value of A[i] is i^2 - i + 1. \n\nThe third line of the method starts a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from i = 1 to n, and the inner loop iterates from j = i+1 to n. The innermost loop iterates from k = j+1 to n. \n\nThe fourth line of the method checks if (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 = 0. If it is, then it increments ans by 1. \n\nThe fifth line of the method returns ans. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the Java-specific libraries with their C++ equivalents.

The function is defined in the `Problem` class.\n\nThe first line of the code imports several Java libraries that are used in the implementation of the function. The `java.util.*` library is used for various utility classes such as `ArrayList` and `Collections`. The `java.lang.reflect.*` library is used for reflection, which is a mechanism for inspecting and modifying the behavior of classes, interfaces, and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` library is used for working with tuples, which are ordered lists of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` library is used for security-related classes such as `SecureRandom`. The `java.math.*` library is used for working with large integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io.*` library is used for input and output operations such as reading and writing files. The `java.util.stream.*` library is used for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.\n\nThe `Problem` class contains a single static method called `minPath` that takes in a 2D `ArrayList` of `Long` integers called `grid` and a `long` integer called `k` as input and returns an `ArrayList` of `Long` integers called `ans`. The `minPath` method is defined as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static ArrayList<Long> minPath(ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>> grid, long k) {\n```\n\nThe first line of the method initializes a `long` integer called `n` to the size of the input `grid`:\n\n```java\nlong n = grid.size();\n```\n\nThe next line initializes a `long` integer called `val` to `n * n + 1`:\n\n```java\nlong val = n * n + 1;\n```\n\nThe following two nested `for` loops iterate over each element of the input `grid`:\n\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n```\n\nThe `if` statement inside the nested loops checks if the current element of the `grid` is equal to `1`:\n\n```java\nif (grid.get(i).get(j) == 1) {\n```\n\nIf the current element is equal to `1`, the code creates a new `ArrayList` called `temp` and adds the values of the adjacent elements of the `grid` to it:\n\n```java\nArrayList<Long> temp = new ArrayList<>();\nif (i != 0) {\n    temp.add(grid.get(i - 1).get(j));\n}\nif (j != 0) {\n    temp.add(grid.get(i).get(j - 1));\n}\nif (i != n - 1) {\n    temp.add(grid.get(i + 1).get(j));\n}\nif (j != n - 1) {\n    temp.add(grid.get(i).get(j + 1));\n}\n```\n\nThe `Collections.min` method is then used to find the minimum value in the `temp` `ArrayList` and assign it to the `val` variable:\n\n```java\nval = Collections.min(temp);\n```\n\nAfter the nested loops have finished iterating over all the elements of the `grid`, a new `ArrayList` called `ans` is created:\n\n```java\nArrayList<Long> ans = new ArrayList<>();\n```\n\nThe following `for` loop iterates over the `k` input value:\n\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> minPath(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long k) {\n"

The function replaces each letter in the input string with a letter that is two positions to the right in the alphabet. If a character is not a letter, it is left unchanged. The function is implemented in Java.\n\nThe function first initializes a string `d` with the lowercase English alphabet. It then initializes an empty string `out` that will be used to store the output.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is a letter by checking if its index in the string `d` is not equal to -1. If it is a letter, it computes the index of the new letter by adding 4 to the index of the original letter (i.e., two positions to the right) and taking the result modulo 26 (to wrap around the alphabet). It then appends the new letter to the output string `out`. If the character is not a letter, it simply appends it to the output string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the output string `out`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encrypt(std::string s) {\n"

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Java version\n\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\nclass Problem {\n    public static boolean isPrime(long n) {\n        if (n < 2) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        for (long k = 2; k < n; k++) {\n            if (n % k == 0) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that checks if a given number is prime or not. \n\nThe function takes in a long integer `n` and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe function first checks if the input is less than 2, in which case it returns false. \n\nIf the input is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if the input is divisible by any number between 2 and n-1. If it is divisible by any number in that range, the function returns false. If it is not divisible by any number in that range, the function returns true. \n\nThe function is defined as a static method of a class called `Problem`. \n\nThe class imports several packages: \n- `java.util.*` which contains utility classes for data structures and other general purpose classes\n- `java.lang.reflect.*` which provides classes for implementing reflection\n- `org.javatuples.*` which provides classes for working with tuples\n- `java.security.*` which provides classes for implementing security features\n- `java.math.*` which provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers\n- `java.io.*` which provides classes for working with input and output\n\nHowever, none of these packages are actually used in the implementation of the `isPrime` function. \n\nThe class also contains a `main` method, but this method is empty and does not do anything. \n\nThe code uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers between 2 and n-1. The loop variable `k` is initialized to 2, and the loop continues as long as `k` is less than `n`. \n\nThe loop checks if `n` is divisible by `k` using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by `k`, the function returns false, indicating that `n` is not prime. \n\nIf the loop completes without finding any factors of `n`, the function returns true, indicating that `n` is prime. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n"
