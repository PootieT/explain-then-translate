The function returns false if the brackets are not balanced.\n\nThe function takes a string of brackets as input and initializes a variable `depth` to 0. It then iterates over each character in the string using a for-each loop. For each character, it checks if it is an opening bracket (i.e. '('). If it is, it increments the `depth` variable. If it is not, it decrements the `depth` variable. If the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns false. If the loop completes without returning false, the function checks if the `depth` variable is 0, which means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also defines a class `Problem` with a static method `correctBracketing`. The `public` keyword before the method name means that the method can be called from outside the class. The `static` keyword means that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. The `boolean` keyword before the method name means that the method returns a boolean value. The `String` parameter in the method signature means that the method takes a string as input. The `char` type is used to represent individual characters in the string. The `toCharArray()` method is called on the input string to convert it to an array of characters, which can be iterated over using a for-each loop. The `if` statement is used to check if a character is an opening bracket or not. The `return` statement is used to return a value from the function. The `==` operator is used to check if two values are equal. The `else` keyword is used to specify what to do if the `if` condition is not true. The `return` statement is used to return a value from the function. The `==` operator is used to check if two values are equal. The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is not used in this code and can be ignored. The `Stream` class is used to create a stream of elements from a collection or array. The `map` method is used to apply a function to each element in the stream. The `collect` method is used to collect the elements of the stream into a collection or array. The `Arrays` class is used to manipulate arrays. The `asList` method is used to convert an array to a list. The `Tuple` class is used to represent a tuple of values. The `of` method is used to create a tuple with a specified number of values. The `BigInteger` class is used to represent integers of arbitrary size. The `File` class is used to represent a file or directory on the file system. The `try` keyword is used to specify a block of code to be executed and catch any exceptions that occur. The `catch` keyword is used to specify what to do if an exception occurs. The `IOException` class is used to represent an input/output exception. The `finally` keyword is used to specify a block of code to be executed after the `try` block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

The result of the calculation is returned as a float value.\n\nThe rest of the code is not used in the implementation of the `triangleArea` function. It imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also defines a class `Problem` and a `main` method, but these are not used in the implementation of the `triangleArea` function. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function to calculate the area of a triangle, and can be easily translated to C++ by defining a function with the same signature and body. The only difference would be the use of `float` instead of `float32` in C++. \n\n```cpp\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long h) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_139_special_factorial", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong special_factorial(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_139_special_factorial.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = special_factorial;\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (288));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (34560));\n    assert(candidate((7)) == (125411328000));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (1));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function calculates a special factorial of the input value.\n\nThe function initializes two variables, `factI` and `specialFact`, both of type `long`, to 1. It then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, the input value. In each iteration, it multiplies `factI` by the current value of `i` and multiplies `specialFact` by the current value of `factI`. Finally, the function returns the value of `specialFact`.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. These libraries include `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. The `*` character is used as a wildcard to import all classes in the specified package.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The `public static` keywords are used to define a public static method called `specialFactorial` that belongs to the `Problem` class.\n\nThe `long` keyword is used to define variables of type `long`. The `for` loop is used to iterate over a range of values. The `*=`, `++`, and `<=` operators are used to perform multiplication, incrementation, and comparison operations, respectively.\n\nThe `return` keyword is used to return a value from the function. The `stream()` method is used to create a stream from a collection or array. The `collect()` method is used to collect the elements of a stream into a collection or array. The `toArray()` method is used to convert a collection into an array. The `BigInteger` class is used to represent arbitrarily large integers. The `valueOf()` method is used to create a `BigInteger` object from a `long` value. The `multiply()` method is used to multiply two `BigInteger` objects. The `reduce()` method is used to reduce a stream of `BigInteger` objects to a single `BigInteger` object by applying a binary operator. The `orElse()` method is used to return a default value if the stream is empty. The `get()` method is used to retrieve the value of an `Optional` object. The `write()` method is used to write data to an output stream. The `close()` method is used to close an output stream. The `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during execution of the code.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong special_factorial(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_109_move_one_ball", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool move_one_ball(std::vector<long> arr) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_109_move_one_ball.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = move_one_ball;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)1, (long)2}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)5, (long)10, (long)1, (long)2}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)3, (long)1, (long)2}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)5, (long)4, (long)1, (long)2}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (true));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if it is possible to move one ball from one position to another in the ArrayList such that the ArrayList is sorted in ascending order. \n\nThe function first checks if the ArrayList is empty. If it is, it returns true. \n\nIf the ArrayList is not empty, the function creates a sorted copy of the ArrayList called `sortedArray` using the `Collections.sort()` method. It then finds the index of the minimum value in the original ArrayList using the `Collections.min()` method and stores it in `minIndex`. \n\nThe function then creates a new ArrayList called `myArr` which contains all the elements of the original ArrayList starting from `minIndex` to the end of the ArrayList, followed by all the elements from the start of the ArrayList to `minIndex`. This effectively rotates the ArrayList so that the minimum value is at the beginning. \n\nThe function then iterates through the original ArrayList and checks if the elements in `myArr` are in the same order as the sorted copy of the ArrayList. If they are not, the function returns false. If they are, the function returns true. \n\nThe function is written in Java and uses several built-in Java libraries such as `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also uses Java 8 features such as `java.util.stream`. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, one would need to replace the ArrayList with a vector, and replace the Java libraries with their C++ equivalents. The `Collections.sort()` method can be replaced with the `std::sort()` method, and the `Collections.min()` method can be replaced with the `std::min_element()` method. The `ArrayList.subList()` method can be replaced with the `std::vector::erase()` and `std::vector::insert()` methods. The `List` interface can be replaced with the `std::vector` class. The `for` loop can be replaced with a `while` loop or a range-based `for` loop. The `return` statements can remain the same. \n\nHere is an example of what the C++ code might look like:\n\n```cpp\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool move_one_ball(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_131_digits", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong digits(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_131_digits.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = digits;\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((54)) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((120)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((5014)) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((98765)) == (315));\n    assert(candidate((5576543)) == (2625));\n    assert(candidate((2468)) == (0));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The new value is then added to the end of the ArrayList, and the first value in the ArrayList is removed. \n\nAfter the loop completes, the function returns the last value in the `results` ArrayList, which is the fourth Fibonacci number. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib4(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_37_sort_even", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_even(std::vector<long> l) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_37_sort_even.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = sort_even;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)3, (long)-5, (long)2, (long)-3, (long)3, (long)9, (long)0, (long)123, (long)1, (long)-10}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-10, (long)3, (long)-5, (long)2, (long)-3, (long)3, (long)5, (long)0, (long)9, (long)1, (long)123})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)8, (long)-12, (long)4, (long)23, (long)2, (long)3, (long)11, (long)12, (long)-10}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-12, (long)8, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)2, (long)12, (long)11, (long)23, (long)-10})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `orderByPoints` and takes an ArrayList of long integers as input. It returns a new ArrayList that contains the same elements as the input ArrayList, but sorted in ascending order based on the sum of their digits.\n\nThe function uses Java 8 streams to sort the ArrayList. The `sorted` method takes a lambda expression that compares two long integers `a` and `b` by calling the `digitsSum` function on each of them and comparing the results using the `Long.compare` method. The `collect` method collects the sorted elements into a new ArrayList.\n\nThe `digitsSum` function takes a long integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is negative, the function multiplies the sum by -1 to account for the negative sign. The function converts `n` to a string and then iterates over each character in the string, converting it to a long integer and adding it to an array of digits. The function then multiplies the first digit by `neg` to account for the negative sign and returns the sum of the digits using the `Arrays.stream` method. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the code, so they could be removed. The `Problem` class is also not used in the code, so it could be removed as well. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> order_by_points(std::vector<long> nums) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_80_is_happy", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_happy(std::string s) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_80_is_happy.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_happy;\n    assert(candidate((\"a\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"aa\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcd\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"aabb\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"adb\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"xyy\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"iopaxpoi\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"iopaxioi\")) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has a single static method called `isHappy` that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe `isHappy` method first checks if the length of the input string is less than 3. If it is, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, the method iterates over the characters of the string, checking if any three consecutive characters are equal. If any three consecutive characters are equal, the method returns `false`. If no three consecutive characters are equal, the method returns `true`.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. The `java.util.*` import statement imports the entire `java.util` package, which contains various utility classes and interfaces. The `java.lang.reflect.*` import statement imports the entire `java.lang.reflect` package, which contains classes and interfaces that are used to obtain information about classes and objects. The `org.javatuples.*` import statement imports the entire `org.javatuples` package, which contains classes for working with tuples. The `java.security.*` import statement imports the entire `java.security` package, which contains classes and interfaces for security-related tasks. The `java.math.*` import statement imports the entire `java.math` package, which contains classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers. The `java.io.*` import statement imports the entire `java.io` package, which contains classes for working with input and output streams. The `java.util.stream.*` import statement imports the entire `java.util.stream` package, which contains classes for working with streams of data.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The class has a single static method called `isHappy`. The `public` keyword is used to specify that the method can be accessed from outside the class. The `static` keyword is used to specify that the method is a class method, rather than an instance method. The `boolean` keyword is used to specify that the method returns a boolean value. The method takes a single parameter, which is a string.\n\nThe body of the `isHappy` method contains a single `if` statement and a `for` loop. The `if` statement checks if the length of the input string is less than 3. If it is, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, the `for` loop iterates over the characters of the string, checking if any three consecutive characters are equal. If any three consecutive characters are equal, the method returns `false`. If no three consecutive characters are equal, the method returns `true`. \n\nThe `charAt` method is used to get the character at a specific index in the string. The `length` method is used to get the length of the string. The `return` keyword is used to return a value from the method. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are not strictly necessary for the `isHappy` method to work, but they may be used in other parts of the code. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_happy(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_65_circular_shift", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string circular_shift(long x, long shift) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_65_circular_shift.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = circular_shift;\n    assert(candidate((100), (2)) == (\"001\"));\n    assert(candidate((12), (2)) == (\"12\"));\n    assert(candidate((97), (8)) == (\"79\"));\n    assert(candidate((12), (1)) == (\"21\"));\n    assert(candidate((11), (101)) == (\"11\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function calculates the maximum number of times the capacity can be filled with the sum of the elements in each subarray of the input ArrayList. \n\nThe function first imports several Java libraries: `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that can be used in the function.\n\nThe function then defines a method `maxFill` that takes an ArrayList of ArrayLists of Longs and a Long capacity as input and returns a Long. The method is public and static, meaning it can be called from outside the class and does not require an instance of the class to be created.\n\nThe method uses the `stream()` method to convert the input ArrayList of ArrayLists of Longs to a stream of ArrayLists of Longs. It then uses the `mapToLong()` method to map each ArrayList of Longs to the sum of its elements as a Long. It then uses the `map()` method to map each sum to the ceiling of the sum divided by the capacity as a Long. Finally, it uses the `sum()` method to sum all the Longs in the resulting stream and returns the result. \n\nThe function uses several Java features that may not be available in C++, including ArrayLists, streams, and lambda expressions. To rewrite the function in C++, one would need to use equivalent data structures and functions. For example, one could use vectors instead of ArrayLists and accumulate instead of streams. The lambda expression could be replaced with a function pointer or a lambda function in C++. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong max_fill(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long capacity) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_0_has_close_elements", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_0_has_close_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = has_close_elements;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.2f})), (0.3f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.2f})), (0.05f)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)5.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f})), (0.95f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)5.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f})), (0.8f)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.0f})), (0.1f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.1f, (float)2.2f, (float)3.1f, (float)4.1f, (float)5.1f})), (1.0f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.1f, (float)2.2f, (float)3.1f, (float)4.1f, (float)5.1f})), (0.5f)) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It returns true if there are two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold value. Otherwise, it returns false.\n\nThe function is defined in a class called `Problem`. It is a static method, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The method is called `hasCloseElements`. It takes two arguments: an `ArrayList` of `Float` objects called `numbers`, and a `float` called `threshold`. \n\nThe method returns a boolean value. It is true if there are two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold value. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nThe method uses a nested for loop to iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the list. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the list, while the inner loop iterates over the same indices. The if statement inside the inner loop checks if the two indices are different. If they are, it calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers and checks if it is less than the threshold value. If it is, the method returns true.\n\nIf the method has not returned true by the end of the nested loops, it returns false. \n\nThe code imports several packages at the beginning of the file. These packages are used to provide additional functionality to the code. The `java.util` package provides utility classes for working with collections, like `ArrayList`. The `java.lang.reflect` package provides classes for working with reflection, which is a way to inspect and modify the behavior of classes at runtime. The `org.javatuples` package provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered collections of elements. The `java.security` package provides classes for working with security-related functionality, like encryption and decryption. The `java.math` package provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The `java.io` package provides classes for working with input and output streams. The `java.util.stream` package provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. \n\nThe code also defines a `class` called `Problem`. This is a container for the `hasCloseElements` method. It does not have any other methods or fields. \n\nFinally, the code defines a `main` method, which is not used in this implementation. It is a standard entry point for Java programs, but it is not necessary for this implementation. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_81_numerical_letter_grade", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> numerical_letter_grade(std::vector<float> grades) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_81_numerical_letter_grade.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = numerical_letter_grade;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)4.0f, (float)3, (float)1.7f, (float)2, (float)3.5f}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"A+\", (std::string)\"B\", (std::string)\"C-\", (std::string)\"C\", (std::string)\"A-\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.2f}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"D+\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)0.5f}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"D-\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)0.0f}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"E\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)0.3f, (float)1.5f, (float)2.8f, (float)3.3f}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"D\", (std::string)\"D-\", (std::string)\"C-\", (std::string)\"B\", (std::string)\"B+\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)0.0f, (float)0.7f}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"E\", (std::string)\"D-\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the letter grade for each of the numerical grades in the input ArrayList. \n\nThe function starts by creating an ArrayList of Strings called `letterGrade`. \n\nThe function then loops through each of the elements in the input ArrayList. For each element in the input ArrayList, the function checks the value of the element and appends the corresponding letter grade to the `letterGrade` ArrayList. \n\nThe function then returns the `letterGrade` ArrayList.\n\nThe function uses the following grading scale:\n\n| Numerical Grade | Letter Grade |\n| --- | --- |\n| 4.0 | A+ |\n| 3.7 - 4.0 | A |\n| 3.3 - 3.7 | A- |\n| 3.0 - 3.3 | B+ |\n| 2.7 - 3.0 | B |\n| 2.3 - 2.7 | B- |\n| 2.0 - 2.3 | C+ |\n| 1.7 - 2.0 | C |\n| 1.3 - 1.7 | C- |\n| 1.0 - 1.3 | D+ |\n| 0.7 - 1.0 | D |\n| 0.0 - 0.7 | D- |\n| < 0.0 | E |\n\nThe function uses the `ArrayList` class from the `java.util` package to create the `letterGrade` ArrayList. \n\nThe function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the input ArrayList. The loop variable `gpa` is of type `Float` and is assigned the value of the current element in the input ArrayList. \n\nThe function uses a series of `if` statements to check the value of `gpa` and append the corresponding letter grade to the `letterGrade` ArrayList. \n\nThe function returns the `letterGrade` ArrayList. \n\nThe function does not have any side effects. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> numerical_letter_grade(std::vector<float> grades) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_150_x_or_y", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong x_or_y(long n, long x, long y) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_150_x_or_y.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = x_or_y;\n    assert(candidate((7), (34), (12)) == (34));\n    assert(candidate((15), (8), (5)) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((3), (33), (5212)) == (33));\n    assert(candidate((1259), (3), (52)) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((7919), (-1), (12)) == (-1));\n    assert(candidate((3609), (1245), (583)) == (583));\n    assert(candidate((91), (56), (129)) == (129));\n    assert(candidate((6), (34), (1234)) == (1234));\n    assert(candidate((1), (2), (0)) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((2), (2), (0)) == (2));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `xOrY` and is defined in the `Problem` class. \n\nThe function first checks if the first input `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns the third input `y`. Otherwise, it loops through all integers from 2 to `n-1` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by each of them. If `n` is divisible by any of them, it returns the third input `y`. If `n` is not divisible by any of them, it returns the second input `x`.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file. These libraries are used to provide additional functionality to the code. The `java.util.*` library provides utility classes for data structures, such as lists and maps. The `java.lang.reflect.*` library provides classes for working with reflection, which is a way to inspect and modify the behavior of classes, interfaces, and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered collections of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` library provides classes for working with security-related functionality, such as encryption and decryption. The `java.math.*` library provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io.*` library provides classes for working with input and output streams. The `java.util.stream.*` library provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. \n\nThe `Problem` class is defined at the beginning of the file. It contains a single static method called `xOrY`, which is the implementation of the function described above. The method takes three long integers as input and returns a long integer. The `public` keyword indicates that the method can be accessed from outside the class. The `static` keyword indicates that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. \n\nThe `long` keyword is used to indicate that the input and output values are 64-bit integers. The `if` statement is used to check if `n` is equal to 1. The `return` statement is used to return a value from the method. The `for` loop is used to iterate over all integers from 2 to `n-1` (inclusive). The `%` operator is used to check if `n` is divisible by `i`. The `==` operator is used to check if two values are equal. The `&&` operator is used to combine two conditions into a single condition. \n\nThe code does not contain any comments, which are used to provide additional information about the code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to make the code more readable and understandable. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong x_or_y(long n, long x, long y) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_146_specialFilter", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong specialFilter(std::vector<long> nums) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_146_specialFilter.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = specialFilter;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)-2, (long)1, (long)-5}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)15, (long)-73, (long)14, (long)-15}))) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)33, (long)-2, (long)-3, (long)45, (long)21, (long)109}))) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)43, (long)-12, (long)93, (long)125, (long)121, (long)109}))) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)71, (long)-2, (long)-33, (long)75, (long)21, (long)19}))) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (0));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes a string as input and returns a long integer that represents the number of distinct characters in the string. \n\nThe function is defined in the class `Problem`. The `public` keyword indicates that the function is accessible from outside the class. The `static` keyword indicates that the function is a class method, which means that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The return type of the function is `long`, which is a 64-bit integer.\n\nThe function is named `countDistinctCharacters` and takes a single parameter of type `String`. The parameter is named `string`.\n\nThe body of the function consists of a single line of code that calls several methods on the input string. The `toLowerCase` method is called on the input string to convert all characters to lowercase. The `chars` method is called on the resulting string to obtain an `IntStream` of the Unicode code points of the characters in the string. The `distinct` method is called on the `IntStream` to obtain a new `IntStream` that contains only the distinct code points. Finally, the `count` method is called on the `IntStream` to obtain the number of distinct code points, which is returned as the result of the function.\n\nThe function uses several classes from the Java standard library, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These classes provide various utility functions and data structures that are used in the implementation of the function. The `java.util.stream.*` class is used to obtain an `IntStream` from the input string.\n\nOverall, the function is a concise and efficient implementation of the problem of counting the number of distinct characters in a string. It uses several built-in methods and classes from the Java standard library to achieve this goal. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong count_distinct_characters(std::string string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_148_bf", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> bf(std::string planet1, std::string planet2) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_148_bf.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = bf;\n    assert(candidate((\"Jupiter\"), (\"Neptune\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Saturn\", (std::string)\"Uranus\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"Earth\"), (\"Mercury\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Venus\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"Mercury\"), (\"Uranus\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Venus\", (std::string)\"Earth\", (std::string)\"Mars\", (std::string)\"Jupiter\", (std::string)\"Saturn\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"Neptune\"), (\"Venus\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Earth\", (std::string)\"Mars\", (std::string)\"Jupiter\", (std::string)\"Saturn\", (std::string)\"Uranus\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"Earth\"), (\"Earth\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((\"Mars\"), (\"Earth\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((\"Jupiter\"), (\"Makemake\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The ArrayList is empty if `planet1` and `planet2` are the same or if either of them is not a valid planet name.\n\nThe function starts by creating an ArrayList of strings called `planetNames` that contains the names of the planets in the solar system in order from the closest to the sun to the farthest. \n\nThe function then checks if `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names and not the same. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an empty ArrayList.\n\nIf both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names and not the same, the function finds the index of each planet in the `planetNames` ArrayList using the `indexOf` method. \n\nIf `planet1` comes before `planet2` in the `planetNames` ArrayList, the function returns a new ArrayList that contains the elements of `planetNames` that are between `planet1` and `planet2`. This is done using the `subList` method, which returns a view of the original ArrayList that contains the elements between the specified indices. The `subList` method is called with the arguments `planet1Index + 1` and `planet2Index`, which means that the returned ArrayList will contain all the elements of `planetNames` that come after `planet1` and before `planet2`.\n\nIf `planet2` comes before `planet1` in the `planetNames` ArrayList, the function returns a new ArrayList that contains the elements of `planetNames` that are between `planet2` and `planet1`. This is done in the same way as before, but with the arguments `planet2Index + 1` and `planet1Index`.\n\nThe function is written in Java and uses several built-in Java classes and methods, including `ArrayList`, `Arrays`, `String`, `Integer`, `Collections`, `List`, `Math`, `Scanner`, `System`, `File`, `IOException`, `Stream`, and others. It also imports several external libraries, including `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, and `java.math`. The purpose of these libraries is not clear from the code, but they may be used in other parts of the program that are not shown here. \n\nThe function does not modify any variables or objects outside of its own scope, and it does not have any side effects. It is therefore a pure function that can be safely called multiple times with the same arguments. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, one would need to replace the Java-specific classes and methods with their C++ equivalents. For example, the `ArrayList` class could be replaced with a `vector` or `list`, the `Arrays.asList` method could be replaced with a `std::initializer_list`, and the `indexOf` method could be replaced with a `std::find` algorithm. The `subList` method could be replaced with a combination of `std::distance` and `std::copy`, or with a custom loop that iterates over the elements of the vector and copies them to a new vector. The `String` class could be replaced with a `std::string`, and the `ArrayList<String>` return type could be replaced with a `vector<std::string>`. The `if` statements could be rewritten using C++ syntax, and the `new ArrayList<>` syntax could be replaced with a `std::vector<std::string>()` constructor.

The class has one static method called `digitSum` that takes a string as an argument and returns a long. The method calculates the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in the string.\n\nThe first line of the code imports several Java libraries: `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various utility classes and methods that are used in the code.\n\nThe second line of the code declares the `Problem` class.\n\nThe third line of the code declares the `digitSum` method. The method takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a long. The method checks if the string is empty. If it is, the method returns 0. Otherwise, the method uses the `chars` method of the `String` class to get a stream of integer values representing the characters in the string. The `filter` method of the `Stream` class is then used to filter out all characters that are not uppercase. Finally, the `sum` method of the `IntStream` class is used to calculate the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in the string.\n\nThe code does not have a `main` method, so it cannot be run directly. It is meant to be used as a utility class that can be imported and used in other Java programs. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong digitSum(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_142_sum_squares", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong sum_squares(std::vector<long> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_142_sum_squares.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = sum_squares;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (6));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)9}))) == (14));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1}))) == (9));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)-1}))) == (-3));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-5, (long)2, (long)-1, (long)-5}))) == (-126));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-56, (long)-99, (long)1, (long)0, (long)-2}))) == (3030));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)0, (long)0, (long)0, (long)0, (long)0, (long)0, (long)0, (long)-1}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-16, (long)-9, (long)-2, (long)36, (long)36, (long)26, (long)-20, (long)25, (long)-40, (long)20, (long)-4, (long)12, (long)-26, (long)35, (long)37}))) == (-14196));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-3, (long)17, (long)-1, (long)-15, (long)13, (long)-1, (long)14, (long)-14, (long)-12, (long)-5, (long)14, (long)-14, (long)6, (long)13, (long)11, (long)16, (long)16, (long)4, (long)10}))) == (-1448));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The function fib() takes a long integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nThe first line of the code imports various Java libraries, including java.util, java.lang.reflect, org.javatuples, java.security, java.math, java.io, and java.util.stream. These libraries provide various functions and classes that the code will use.\n\nThe second line defines a class called Problem. This class contains a single static method called fib() that takes a long integer n as input and returns a long integer. The static keyword means that the method belongs to the class itself, rather than to any particular instance of the class.\n\nThe third line defines the fib() method. The method first checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, the method returns 0. If n is not equal to 0, the method checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, the method returns 1. If n is neither 0 nor 1, the method returns the sum of the two preceding numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, which are calculated by recursively calling the fib() method with n-1 and n-2 as inputs.\n\nThe code does not have any main() method, so it cannot be run directly. However, it can be used as a library by other Java programs that import the Problem class and call the fib() method. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the Java-specific syntax with C++ equivalents. For example, you would need to replace the import statements with #include statements, and replace the long data type with the C++ equivalent. You would also need to write a main() function to call the fib() method and print the result. Here is an example C++ implementation of the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n```\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_36_fizz_buzz", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fizz_buzz(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_36_fizz_buzz.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = fizz_buzz;\n    assert(candidate((50)) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((78)) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((79)) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((100)) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((200)) == (6));\n    assert(candidate((4000)) == (192));\n    assert(candidate((10000)) == (639));\n    assert(candidate((100000)) == (8026));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `fizzBuzz` takes an argument `n` of type `long` and returns a value of type `long`. \n\nThe function first creates an empty list of type `Long` called `ns`. \n\nIt then loops through all numbers from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, the number is added to the list `ns`. \n\nAfter the loop, the function creates a variable `s` of type `long`. It uses the `stream()` method of the `ns` list to create a stream of `Long` objects. It then maps each `Long` object to a `String` representation of itself using the `map()` method. \n\nThe `flatMapToInt()` method is then called on the stream of `String` objects. This method flattens the stream of `String` objects into a stream of `int` values. Each `String` is converted to a stream of `int` values using the `chars()` method, which returns an `IntStream` of Unicode code points. \n\nThe `filter()` method is then called on the stream of `int` values. It filters out all values that are not equal to the Unicode code point for the character '7'. The `count()` method is then called on the filtered stream of `int` values to get the number of occurrences of the character '7'. \n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `s`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fizz_buzz(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_153_Strongest_Extension", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string Strongest_Extension(std::string class_name, std::vector<std::string> extensions) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_153_Strongest_Extension.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = Strongest_Extension;\n    assert(candidate((\"Watashi\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"tEN\", (std::string)\"niNE\", (std::string)\"eIGHt8OKe\"}))) == (\"Watashi.eIGHt8OKe\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"Boku123\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"nani\", (std::string)\"NazeDa\", (std::string)\"YEs.WeCaNe\", (std::string)\"32145tggg\"}))) == (\"Boku123.YEs.WeCaNe\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"__YESIMHERE\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"t\", (std::string)\"eMptY\", (std::string)\"nothing\", (std::string)\"zeR00\", (std::string)\"NuLl__\", (std::string)\"123NoooneB321\"}))) == (\"__YESIMHERE.NuLl__\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"K\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Ta\", (std::string)\"TAR\", (std::string)\"t234An\", (std::string)\"cosSo\"}))) == (\"K.TAR\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"__HAHA\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Tab\", (std::string)\"123\", (std::string)\"781345\", (std::string)\"-_-\"}))) == (\"__HAHA.123\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"YameRore\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"HhAas\", (std::string)\"okIWILL123\", (std::string)\"WorkOut\", (std::string)\"Fails\", (std::string)\"-_-\"}))) == (\"YameRore.okIWILL123\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"finNNalLLly\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Die\", (std::string)\"NowW\", (std::string)\"Wow\", (std::string)\"WoW\"}))) == (\"finNNalLLly.WoW\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"_\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Bb\", (std::string)\"91245\"}))) == (\"_.Bb\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"Sp\"), (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"671235\", (std::string)\"Bb\"}))) == (\"Sp.671235\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If there are multiple extensions with the same number of uppercase letters, the function returns the first one in the list.\n\nThe function is called `StrongestExtension` and takes two arguments: `class_name` and `extensions`. `class_name` is a string representing the name of a class, and `extensions` is an ArrayList of strings representing the names of the extensions.\n\nThe first line of the function initializes a variable `strong` to the first extension in the list.\n\nThe second line initializes a variable `myVal` to the number of uppercase letters in the first extension minus the number of lowercase letters in the first extension.\n\nThe third line starts a loop that iterates over each extension in the list. The loop variable `s` represents the current extension.\n\nThe fourth line initializes a variable `val` to the number of uppercase letters in the current extension minus the number of lowercase letters in the current extension.\n\nThe fifth line checks if `val` is greater than `myVal`. If it is, then `strong` is set to the current extension, and `myVal` is set to `val`.\n\nThe function returns a string that concatenates `class_name`, a period, and `strong`. This is the name of the strongest extension.\n\nThe code imports several packages at the beginning of the file. `java.util.*` provides utility classes for working with collections, `java.lang.reflect.*` provides classes for working with reflection, `org.javatuples.*` provides classes for working with tuples, `java.security.*` provides classes for working with security, `java.math.*` provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers, and `java.io.*` provides classes for working with input and output. `java.util.stream.*` provides classes for working with streams.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Java version\n\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\nclass Problem {\n    public static Pair<Float, Float> findClosestElements(ArrayList<Float> numbers) {\n        Pair<Float, Float> closestPair = null;\n        Float distance = null;\n\n        for (int idx = 0; idx < numbers.size(); idx++) {\n            Float elem = numbers.get(idx);\n            for (int idx2 = 0; idx2 < numbers.size(); idx2++) {\n                Float elem2 = numbers.get(idx2);\n                if (idx != idx2) {\n                    Float newDistance = Math.abs(elem - elem2);\n                    if (distance == null || newDistance < distance) {\n                        distance = newDistance;\n                        closestPair = Pair.with(Math.min(elem, elem2), Math.max(elem, elem2));\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return closestPair;\n    }\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that finds the closest pair of elements in an array of floating point numbers. The function takes an ArrayList of Floats as input and returns a Pair of Floats representing the closest pair of elements. \n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables, closestPair and distance, to null. These variables will be used to keep track of the closest pair of elements and the distance between them, respectively.\n\nThe function then loops through the input ArrayList twice, comparing each element to every other element in the ArrayList. If the two elements being compared are not the same element (i.e. they have different indices), the function calculates the absolute difference between the two elements and stores it in a newDistance variable. If the distance variable is null (i.e. this is the first comparison being made), or if the newDistance is smaller than the current distance, the function updates the closestPair variable to be a Pair of the two elements being compared, with the smaller element as the first element of the Pair and the larger element as the second element of the Pair. The function also updates the distance variable to be the newDistance.\n\nAfter all comparisons have been made, the function returns the closestPair variable, which will be null if no pair of elements was found (i.e. the input ArrayList was empty or contained only one element). \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including java.util.*, which provides various utility classes and interfaces, java.lang.reflect.*, which provides classes and interfaces for working with reflection, org.javatuples.*, which provides classes for working with tuples, java.security.*, which provides classes and interfaces for working with security, java.math.*, which provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers, and java.io.*, which provides classes for working with input and output. The code also uses Java 8 streams to manipulate the input ArrayList. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the ArrayList with a vector, and replace the Pair class with a struct or a pair of floats. You would also need to replace the Math.abs() function with the abs() function from the cmath library. The rest of the code should be straightforward to translate. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<float, float> find_closest_elements(std::vector<float> numbers) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_124_valid_date", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool valid_date(std::string date) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_124_valid_date.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = valid_date;\n    assert(candidate((\"03-11-2000\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"15-01-2012\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"04-0-2040\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"06-04-2020\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"01-01-2007\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"03-32-2011\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"04-31-3000\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"06-06-2005\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"21-31-2000\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"04-12-2003\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"04122003\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"20030412\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"2003-04\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"2003-04-12\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"04-2003\")) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the input string is a valid date in the format \"MM-DD-YYYY\". If the input is valid, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe function starts by trying to parse the input string as a date. If an exception is thrown during the parsing, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe input string is trimmed to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The trimmed string is then split into an array of strings using the \"-\" character as the separator.\n\nThe first element of the resulting array is parsed as an integer and assigned to the variable `month`. The second element is parsed as an integer and assigned to the variable `day`. The third element is parsed as an integer and assigned to the variable `year`.\n\nThe function then checks if the `month` variable is between 1 and 12 (inclusive). If it is not, the function returns `false`.\n\nNext, the function checks if the `day` variable is valid for the given `month`. If the `month` is one of the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), the `day` variable must be between 1 and 31 (inclusive). If the `month` is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), the `day` variable must be between 1 and 30 (inclusive). If the `month` is February, the `day` variable must be between 1 and 29 (inclusive) if the `year` is a leap year, and between 1 and 28 (inclusive) otherwise.\n\nIf the `month` and `day` variables are both valid, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool valid_date(std::string date) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_53_add", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong add(long x, long y) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_53_add.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = add;\n    assert(candidate((0), (1)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((1), (0)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((2), (3)) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((5), (7)) == (12));\n    assert(candidate((7), (5)) == (12));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. The `java.util` library provides a collection of utility classes, including `Scanner` and `Random`. The `java.lang.reflect` library provides a set of classes and interfaces that allow you to inspect and manipulate the runtime behavior of Java classes. The `org.javatuples` library provides a set of classes for working with tuples. The `java.security` library provides a set of classes and interfaces for managing security, including cryptographic operations. The `java.math` library provides a set of classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io` library provides a set of classes for working with input and output streams.\n\nThe `Problem` class defines a single static method `add` that takes two `long` arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The method is declared `public` and `static`, which means that it can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the `Problem` class. The method is declared `long`, which means that it returns a `long` value. The method body consists of a single statement that adds `x` and `y` and returns the result.\n\nThe `Problem` class does not have a `main` method, which means that it cannot be run as a standalone program. Instead, it can be used as a library by other Java programs that need to perform addition operations on `long` values. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong add(long x, long y) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_40_triples_sum_to_zero", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool triples_sum_to_zero(std::vector<long> l) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_40_triples_sum_to_zero.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = triples_sum_to_zero;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)5, (long)0}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)5, (long)-1}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)-2, (long)1}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)7}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)5, (long)7}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)4, (long)-5, (long)3, (long)9, (long)7}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)5, (long)-100}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)100, (long)3, (long)5, (long)-100}))) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if there are any three numbers in the list that sum to zero. \n\nThe first line of the code imports several Java libraries. The `java.util.*` library is used for utility classes such as `ArrayList`. The `java.lang.reflect.*` library is used for reflection, which is a way to inspect and modify classes and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` library is used for working with tuples, which are objects that contain a fixed number of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` library is used for security-related classes. The `java.math.*` library is used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The `java.io.*` library is used for input and output operations. The `java.util.stream.*` library is used for processing collections of data in a functional style.\n\nThe `Problem` class contains a single static method called `triplesSumToZero`. The method takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns a boolean. \n\nThe method uses three nested for loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three numbers in the list. The outer loop iterates over the first number, the middle loop iterates over the second number, and the inner loop iterates over the third number. The loops are designed so that each combination of three numbers is considered exactly once. \n\nThe if statement inside the innermost loop checks if the sum of the three numbers is equal to zero. If it is, the method returns true. If no combination of three numbers sums to zero, the method returns false. \n\nThe code does not have any input or output statements, so it is not clear how the `triplesSumToZero` method is intended to be used. It could be called from another part of the program, or it could be used as a standalone function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool triples_sum_to_zero(std::vector<long> l) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_24_largest_divisor", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong largest_divisor(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_24_largest_divisor.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = largest_divisor;\n    assert(candidate((3)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((7)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((100)) == (50));\n    assert(candidate((49)) == (7));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has one method called `largestDivisor` that takes a `long` as an argument and returns a `long`.\n\nThe method `largestDivisor` is a simple function that takes a number and returns the largest divisor of that number. It does this by iterating over all numbers from `n-1` to `1` and checking if each number is a divisor of `n`. If it is, then it returns that number as the largest divisor. If no divisor is found, it returns `1`.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. These libraries include `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that are used in the code.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new Java class called `Problem`. The class has one method called `largestDivisor`.\n\nThe `public` keyword is used to specify that the method `largestDivisor` can be accessed from outside the class.\n\nThe `static` keyword is used to specify that the method `largestDivisor` can be called without creating an instance of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe `long` keyword is used to specify that the method `largestDivisor` takes a `long` as an argument and returns a `long`.\n\nThe `for` loop is used to iterate over all numbers from `n-1` to `1`. The loop starts with `i` equal to `n-1` and decrements `i` by `1` each time through the loop until `i` is equal to `1`.\n\nThe `if` statement is used to check if `i` is a divisor of `n`. If `n % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `n` and the method returns `i` as the largest divisor.\n\nIf no divisor is found, the method returns `1`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong largest_divisor(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_19_sort_numbers", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string sort_numbers(std::string numbers) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_19_sort_numbers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = sort_numbers;\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"three\")) == (\"three\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"three five nine\")) == (\"three five nine\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"five zero four seven nine eight\")) == (\"zero four five seven eight nine\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"six five four three two one zero\")) == (\"zero one two three four five six\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns true if all elements in the ArrayList are less than t, and false otherwise. \n\nThe first line of the code imports various Java libraries, including java.util, java.lang.reflect, org.javatuples, java.security, java.math, java.io, and java.util.stream.

This class contains a single static method called \"belowThreshold\".\n\nThe \"belowThreshold\" method takes in an ArrayList of long integers called \"l\" and a long integer called \"t\". The method returns a boolean value.\n\nThe method then loops through each element \"e\" in the ArrayList \"l\". For each element, it checks if \"e\" is greater than or equal to \"t\". If it is, the method returns false, indicating that not all elements in the ArrayList are less than \"t\". If the loop completes without returning false, the method returns true, indicating that all elements in the ArrayList are less than \"t\". \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that checks if all elements in an ArrayList are less than a given threshold. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool below_threshold(std::vector<long> l, long t) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_128_prod_signs", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<long> prod_signs(std::vector<long> arr) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_128_prod_signs.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = prod_signs;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)2, (long)-4}))) == -9);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)1}))) == 0);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)-1, (long)1}))) == -10);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == std::nullopt);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)4, (long)1, (long)2, (long)-1, (long)-1, (long)9}))) == 20);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)1, (long)-1, (long)1}))) == 4);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1}))) == -4);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)0}))) == 0);\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an empty Optional if the ArrayList is empty. Otherwise, it calculates the product of the signs of the elements in the ArrayList and multiplies it by the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the ArrayList. The product of the signs is calculated as follows: if the ArrayList contains 0, the product is 0. Otherwise, the product is (-1) raised to the power of the number of negative elements in the ArrayList. The sum of the absolute values is calculated using the `map` and `reduce` methods of the ArrayList's stream. The `map` method applies the `Math::abs` function to each element of the stream, and the `reduce` method sums the resulting values. The function returns the product of the signs times the sum of the absolute values as an Optional of Long. \n\nThe code imports several packages: `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These packages provide various classes and methods that are used in the implementation of the `prodSigns` function. \n\nThe `java.util` package provides the ArrayList class, which is used to store the input values. The `java.lang.reflect` package provides the Method class, which is not used in this implementation. The `org.javatuples` package provides the Tuple class, which is not used in this implementation. The `java.security` package provides the SecureRandom class, which is not used in this implementation. The `java.math` package provides the BigInteger class, which is not used in this implementation. The `java.io` package provides the IOException class, which is not used in this implementation. \n\nThe `Problem` class contains the `prodSigns` function, which is declared as `public static`. The function takes an ArrayList of Longs as its parameter and returns an Optional of Long. The function body is enclosed in curly braces. \n\nThe first line of the function checks if the ArrayList is empty using the `isEmpty` method of the ArrayList class. If the ArrayList is empty, the function returns an empty Optional using the `Optional.empty` method. \n\nThe second line of the function calculates the product of the signs of the elements in the ArrayList. The product is stored in the `prod` variable, which is initialized to 0 if the ArrayList contains 0, or (-1) raised to the power of the number of negative elements in the ArrayList otherwise. The `contains` method of the ArrayList class is used to check if the ArrayList contains 0. The `stream` method of the ArrayList class is used to create a stream of the elements in the ArrayList. The `filter` method of the Stream class is used to filter the negative elements in the stream. The `count` method of the Stream class is used to count the number of negative elements in the stream. The `Math.pow` method is used to raise (-1) to the power of the number of negative elements in the ArrayList. \n\nThe third line of the function calculates the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the ArrayList. The `map` method of the Stream class is used to apply the `Math::abs` function to each element of the stream. The `reduce` method of the Stream class is used to sum the resulting values. The `reduce` method takes two arguments: the first argument is the initial value of the sum, which is 0L, and the second argument is a lambda expression that takes two Longs and returns their sum. The lambda expression is represented by the method reference\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<long> prod_signs(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_49_modp", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong modp(long n, long p) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_49_modp.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = modp;\n    assert(candidate((3), (5)) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((1101), (101)) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((0), (101)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((3), (11)) == (8));\n    assert(candidate((100), (101)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((30), (5)) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((31), (5)) == (3));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has one public static method named `countUpper` that takes a string as an argument and returns a long integer. The method counts the number of uppercase vowels in the string. \n\nThe first line of the code imports several classes from the Java standard library: `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These classes provide various utilities for working with data structures, reflection, tuples, security, math, and input/output.\n\nThe second line of the code defines the `Problem` class. The class has only one method, `countUpper`, which is a public static method. The method takes a single argument, a string named `s`, and returns a long integer.\n\nThe third line of the code declares a long integer variable named `count` and initializes it to zero.\n\nThe fourth line of the code starts a for loop that iterates over the characters of the string `s`. The loop variable `i` is initialized to zero, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.\n\nThe fifth line of the code checks if the character at index `i` of the string `s` is an uppercase vowel. The `indexOf` method of the `String` class is used to check if the character is one of the vowels \"AEIOU\". If the character is a vowel, the `count` variable is incremented by one.\n\nThe sixth line of the code returns the final value of the `count` variable, which is the number of uppercase vowels in the string `s`. \n\nThe code uses several Java standard library classes and methods to accomplish its task. The `String` class provides methods for working with strings, such as `charAt` and `indexOf`. The `for` loop is a standard control structure in Java for iterating over a sequence of values. The `long` data type is used to represent large integers. The `public` and `static` keywords are used to define a method that can be called from outside the class without creating an instance of the class. The `import` statement is used to import classes from other packages. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong count_upper(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_97_multiply", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong multiply(long a, long b) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_97_multiply.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = multiply;\n    assert(candidate((148), (412)) == (16));\n    assert(candidate((19), (28)) == (72));\n    assert(candidate((2020), (1851)) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((14), (-15)) == (20));\n    assert(candidate((76), (67)) == (42));\n    assert(candidate((17), (27)) == (49));\n    assert(candidate((0), (1)) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((0), (0)) == (0));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the sum of all the elements in the array list is less than or equal to the second input parameter. If it is not, the function returns false. If the sum of all the elements in the array list is less than or equal to the second input parameter, the function checks if the array list is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns true. If it is not, the function returns false.\n\nThe function first checks if the sum of all the elements in the array list is greater than the second input parameter. If it is, the function returns false. This is done using the `mapToLong` method of the `Stream` class in Java. The `mapToLong` method maps each element of the array list to a long integer and then returns a `LongStream` object. The `sum` method of the `LongStream` class is then called to get the sum of all the long integers in the `LongStream` object. If the sum is greater than the second input parameter, the function returns false.\n\nIf the sum of all the elements in the array list is less than or equal to the second input parameter, the function checks if the array list is a palindrome. This is done using a while loop that iterates through the array list from both ends. The loop starts with two pointers, one at the beginning of the array list and the other at the end of the array list. The loop continues until the two pointers meet in the middle of the array list. At each iteration of the loop, the function checks if the element at the beginning of the array list is equal to the element at the end of the array list. If they are not equal, the function returns false. If they are equal, the pointers are moved one step closer to each other. If the loop completes without returning false, the function returns true.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool will_it_fly(std::vector<long> q, long w) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_75_is_multiply_prime", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_multiply_prime(long a) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_75_is_multiply_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_multiply_prime;\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((30)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((125)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((105)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((126)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((729)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((891)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((1001)) == (true));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the input number is the product of three prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive). \n\nThe `isMultiplyPrime` function uses a nested loop to check all possible combinations of three prime numbers between 2 and 100. The outer loop iterates over all prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive), while the inner two loops iterate over all prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive) as well. The three prime numbers are multiplied together and checked if they equal the input number. If they do, the function returns `true`. If no combination of three prime numbers equals the input number, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe `isPrime` function is a helper function that checks if a given integer is prime. It does this by iterating over all integers between 2 and the input number (exclusive) and checking if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function returns `false`. If no integer between 2 and the input number (exclusive) is a divisor of the input number, the function returns `true`. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the code, so they could be removed without affecting the functionality of the program. \n\nThe `java.util.stream.*` library is imported but not used in the code, so it could also be removed. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and could be easily translated to C++. The main differences between Java and C++ syntax are in the syntax for declaring variables, defining functions, and using loops. However, the logic of the program should be easy to translate to C++. \n\nHere is the C++ equivalent of the `isMultiplyPrime` function:\n\n```c++\nbool isMultiplyPrime(long a) {\n    for (int i = 2; i < 101; i++) {\n        if (!isPrime(i)) continue;\n        for (int j = 2; j < 101; j++) {\n            if (!isPrime(j)) continue;\n            for (int k = 2; k < 101; k++) {\n                if (!isPrime(k)) continue;\n                if (i*j*k == a) return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is the C++ equivalent of the `isPrime` function:\n\n```c++\nbool isPrime(int n) {\n    for (int j = 2; j < n; j++) {\n        if (n%j == 0) return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_multiply_prime(long a) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_120_maximum", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> maximum(std::vector<long> arr, long k) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_120_maximum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = maximum;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-3, (long)-4, (long)5})), (3)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-4, (long)-3, (long)5})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)-4, (long)4})), (2)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-3, (long)2, (long)1, (long)2, (long)-1, (long)-2, (long)1})), (1)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)123, (long)-123, (long)20, (long)0, (long)1, (long)2, (long)-3})), (3)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)20, (long)123})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-123, (long)20, (long)0, (long)1, (long)2, (long)-3})), (4)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)1, (long)2, (long)20})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)15, (long)0, (long)3, (long)-13, (long)-8, (long)0})), (7)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-13, (long)-8, (long)0, (long)0, (long)3, (long)5, (long)15})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)0, (long)2, (long)5, (long)3, (long)-10})), (2)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)5})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)0, (long)5, (long)-7})), (1)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)5})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)-4})), (2)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-4, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-10, (long)10})), (2)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-10, (long)10})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)-23, (long)243, (long)-400, (long)0})), (0)) == (std::vector<long>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If it is, the function returns an empty ArrayList.\n\nIf k is not 0, the function sorts the input ArrayList in ascending order using the `Collections.sort` method. \n\nThe function then returns a new ArrayList that contains the k largest elements of the sorted input ArrayList.

For example, if the input string is `\"(())()((()))\"`, the output array should be `[\"(())\", \"()\", \"((()))\"]`.\n\nThe function starts by creating an empty array list called `result` to store the groups of parentheses. It also creates an empty array list called `current_string` to store the characters of the current group of parentheses, and an integer variable called `current_depth` to keep track of the current depth of the parentheses.\n\nThe function then loops through each character in the input string. If the character is an opening parenthesis, the `current_depth` is incremented and the character is added to the `current_string`. If the character is a closing parenthesis, the `current_depth` is decremented and the character is added to the `current_string`. If the `current_depth` becomes zero, it means that a group of parentheses has been completed, so the characters in `current_string` are concatenated into a string and added to the `result` array list. The `current_string` is then cleared to start building the next group of parentheses.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` array list containing all the groups of parentheses. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> separate_paren_groups(std::string paren_string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_22_filter_integers", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> filter_integers(std::vector<std::any> values) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_22_filter_integers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = filter_integers;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::any>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::any>({4, std::map<long,long>(), std::vector<long>(), 23.2f, 9, \"adasd\"}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)9})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::any>({3, \"c\", 3, 3, \"a\", \"b\"}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)3, (long)3})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `java.util.stream.*` package is imported to use the `Stream` class.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The `public` keyword is used to make the class accessible from outside the package. The `static` keyword is used to define a static method called `filterIntegers` that can be called without creating an instance of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe `ArrayList<Long>` return type specifies that the function returns an `ArrayList` of `Long`s. The `ArrayList<Object> values` parameter specifies that the function takes an `ArrayList` of `Object`s as input.\n\nThe `return` statement returns the `ArrayList` of `Long`s that was created by the `collect()` method. \n\nThe `stream()` method is called on the `values` `ArrayList` to create a stream of the values in the list. The `filter()` method is then called on the stream to filter out any values that are not instances of `Long`. The `map()` method is then called on the filtered stream to cast the remaining values to `Long`. Finally, the `collect()` method is called on the mapped stream to collect the `Long` values into a new `ArrayList`. The `ArrayList::new` syntax is used to create a new `ArrayList` object to collect the values into. \n\nThe `x -> x instanceof Long` lambda expression is used as the argument to the `filter()` method. This lambda expression tests whether the input value is an instance of `Long`. The `x -> (Long) x` lambda expression is used as the argument to the `map()` method. This lambda expression casts the input value to a `Long`. \n\nThe `public static void main(String[] args)` method is not included in the code, but it is the entry point for the program and is required for the program to run. It is not necessary for the `filterIntegers` function to be called from the `main` method. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> filter_integers(std::vector<std::any> values) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_94_skjkasdkd", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong skjkasdkd(std::vector<long> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_94_skjkasdkd.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = skjkasdkd;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)3, (long)2, (long)1, (long)3, (long)5, (long)7, (long)4, (long)5, (long)5, (long)5, (long)2, (long)181, (long)32, (long)4, (long)32, (long)3, (long)2, (long)32, (long)324, (long)4, (long)3}))) == (10));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)0, (long)1, (long)8, (long)2, (long)4597, (long)2, (long)1, (long)3, (long)40, (long)1, (long)2, (long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)2, (long)5, (long)1}))) == (25));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)1, (long)32, (long)5107, (long)34, (long)83278, (long)109, (long)163, (long)23, (long)2323, (long)32, (long)30, (long)1, (long)9, (long)3}))) == (13));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)724, (long)32, (long)71, (long)99, (long)32, (long)6, (long)0, (long)5, (long)91, (long)83, (long)0, (long)5, (long)6}))) == (11));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)81, (long)12, (long)3, (long)1, (long)21}))) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)8, (long)1, (long)2, (long)1, (long)7}))) == (7));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)8191}))) == (19));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)8191, (long)123456, (long)127, (long)7}))) == (19));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)127, (long)97, (long)8192}))) == (10));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two ArrayLists of Strings as input and returns an ArrayList of Strings. \n\nThe first line of the function calculates the total length of all the Strings in the first ArrayList. It does this by calling the `mapToInt` method on the first ArrayList and passing in a method reference to the `length` method of the `String` class. The `mapToInt` method returns an `IntStream` object which is a stream of integers representing the length of each String in the ArrayList. The `sum` method is then called on the `IntStream` object to calculate the total length of all the Strings in the ArrayList. The result is stored in the variable `l1`.\n\nThe second line of the function calculates the total length of all the Strings in the second ArrayList. It does this in the same way as the first line, but using the second ArrayList instead. The result is stored in the variable `l2`.\n\nThe third line of the function returns the ArrayList with the smallest total length. It does this by using the ternary operator to check if `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`. If it is, then it returns the first ArrayList (`lst1`), otherwise it returns the second ArrayList (`lst2`). \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. The `java.util.*` library is used for various utility classes and data structures, such as ArrayLists. The `java.lang.reflect.*` library is used for reflection, which is a way to inspect and modify the behavior of classes, interfaces, and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` library is used for creating tuples, which are immutable objects that contain a fixed number of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` library is used for security-related classes and interfaces, such as cryptographic algorithms and secure random number generators. The `java.math.*` library is used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, which is useful for working with very large or very small numbers. The `java.io.*` library is used for input and output operations, such as reading and writing files. The `java.util.stream.*` library is used for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The `public` keyword is used to specify that the class can be accessed from other classes. The `static` keyword is used to specify that the `totalMatch` method can be called without creating an instance of the `Problem` class. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that compares the total length of two ArrayLists of Strings and returns the ArrayList with the smallest total length. The code uses various Java libraries to perform the necessary calculations and operations. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> total_match(std::vector<std::string> lst1, std::vector<std::string> lst2) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_162_string_to_md5", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<std::string> string_to_md5(std::string text) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_162_string_to_md5.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = string_to_md5;\n    assert(candidate((\"Hello world\")) == \"3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62\");\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == std::nullopt);\n    assert(candidate((\"A B C\")) == \"0ef78513b0cb8cef12743f5aeb35f888\");\n    assert(candidate((\"password\")) == \"5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\");\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `stringToMd5` and takes a single argument, `text`, which is the string to be hashed. \n\nThe function first checks if the input string is null or empty. If it is, the function returns an empty optional.\n\nIf the input string is not null or empty, the function creates a new instance of the `MessageDigest` class, passing \"MD5\" as the algorithm to use. The `MessageDigest` class is part of the `java.security` package and is used for generating message digests (hashes) of input data.\n\nThe function then calls the `digest` method of the `MessageDigest` instance, passing the input string as a byte array encoded in ASCII. The `digest` method returns a byte array that represents the hash of the input string.\n\nThe function then creates a new `BigInteger` instance, passing 1 and the hash byte array as arguments. The `BigInteger` class is part of the `java.math` package and is used for representing arbitrarily large integers. The `1` argument is used to indicate that the byte array should be interpreted as a positive number.\n\nThe function then formats the `BigInteger` as a hexadecimal string with 32 digits, using the `String.format` method. The resulting string is the MD5 hash of the input string.\n\nIf any exceptions are thrown during the execution of the function (either `NoSuchAlgorithmException` or `UnsupportedEncodingException`), the function returns an empty optional. \n\nThe `Optional` class is part of the `java.util` package and is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. In this case, the function returns an empty optional if the input string is null or empty or if an exception is thrown during the execution of the function. Otherwise, the function returns an optional containing the MD5 hash of the input string as a string. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various classes and packages that are used in the implementation of the `stringToMd5` function. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The `public static` keywords are used to indicate that the `stringToMd5` function is a public static method of the `Problem` class. \n\nThe `Stream` class is part of the `java.util.stream` package and is used for processing collections of data in a functional style. It is not used in the implementation of the `stringToMd5` function and can be ignored. \n\nOverall, the code is a straightforward implementation of a function that generates the MD5 hash of a string using the `MessageDigest` and `BigInteger` classes. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<std::string> string_to_md5(std::string text) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_41_car_race_collision", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong car_race_collision(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_41_car_race_collision.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = car_race_collision;\n    assert(candidate((2)) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((3)) == (9));\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (16));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (64));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (100));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The method simply returns the square of the input value.\n\nThe `import` statements at the top of the file are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. The `java.util.*` import statement is used to import the Java utility library, which provides various utility classes and methods.

The `org.javatuples.*` import statement is used to import the JavaTuples library, which provides a way to work with tuples in Java. The `java.security.*` import statement is used to import the Java security library, which provides various security-related classes and methods. The `java.math.*` import statement is used to import the Java math library, which provides various math-related classes and methods. The `java.io.*` import statement is used to import the Java IO library, which provides various IO-related classes and methods. The `java.util.stream.*` import statement is used to import the Java stream library, which provides a way to work with streams in Java.\n\nOverall, the code is very simple and just returns the square of the input value. It does not use any of the imported libraries, so they could be removed without affecting the functionality of the code. To rewrite the code in C++, you could simply define a function that takes in a `long` argument and returns the square of that argument.

The function checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`. A simple power is a power of `n` where the exponent is greater than or equal to 1 and the result is equal to `x`. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1 and `x` is equal to 1. If this is true, then `x` is a simple power of `n` and the function returns `true`. \n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function initializes a variable `power` to 1 and enters a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, `power` is multiplied by `n`. The loop continues until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `power` is equal to `x`, then `x` is a simple power of `n` and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also includes a `java.util.stream` package. However, none of these libraries are used in the `isSimplePower` function. \n\nThe code also includes a class called `Problem`, but this class is empty and does not contain any methods or variables. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_simple_power(long x, long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_93_encode", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encode(std::string message) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_93_encode.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = encode;\n    assert(candidate((\"TEST\")) == (\"tgst\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"Mudasir\")) == (\"mWDCSKR\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"YES\")) == (\"ygs\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"This is a message\")) == (\"tHKS KS C MGSSCGG\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE\")) == (\"k dQnT kNqW wHcT Tq wRkTg\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has two methods: `encode` and `swapCase`. The `encode` method takes a string as input and returns a string. The `swapCase` method takes a string as input and returns a string. \n\nThe `encode` method does the following:\n1. Initializes a string called `vowels` with the value \"aeiouAEIOU\".\n2. Initializes a `HashMap` called `vowels_replace` with `Character` keys and `Character` values.\n3. Loops through each character in the `vowels` string and adds a new key-value pair to the `vowels_replace` map. The key is the current character and the value is the character two positions to the right of the current character in the ASCII table.\n4. Calls the `swapCase` method with the input string as an argument and assigns the result to a variable called `message`.\n5. Initializes a new `StringBuilder` called `sb`.\n6. Loops through each character in the `message` string and checks if the `vowels_replace` map contains the current character as a key. If it does, it appends the corresponding value to the `sb` string. If it does not, it appends the current character to the `sb` string.\n7. Returns the `sb` string.\n\nThe `swapCase` method does the following:\n1. Initializes a new `StringBuilder` called `sb`.\n2. Loops through each character in the input string and checks if the character is uppercase. If it is, it appends the lowercase version of the character to the `sb` string. If it is not, it appends the uppercase version of the character to the `sb` string.\n3. Returns the `sb` string.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encode(std::string message) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_42_incr_list", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> incr_list(std::vector<long> l) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_42_incr_list.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = incr_list;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)3, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)2, (long)5, (long)2, (long)3, (long)3, (long)9, (long)0, (long)123}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)6, (long)3, (long)6, (long)3, (long)4, (long)4, (long)10, (long)1, (long)124})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

s.toLowerCase() : s.toUpperCase()` is used as the transformation function. \n\nThis lambda expression checks whether the input string is uppercase or lowercase, and returns the opposite case. \n\nThe `Collectors` class is used to collect the transformed strings into a single string. \n\nThe `joining` method is called on the `Collectors` class to join the strings together. \n\nThe `\"\"` argument passed to the `split` method is an empty string, which indicates that the input string should be split into individual characters. \n\nThe `Problem` class is not used anywhere else in the code snippet provided, so it is unclear what the purpose of this class is. \n\nIt is possible that this class is used elsewhere in the program that is not shown in the code snippet provided. \n\nOverall, the `flipCase` function is a simple implementation of a string transformation that flips the case of all characters in the input string. \n\nThe implementation uses Java streams and lambda expressions to perform the transformation, and imports several Java libraries that are likely used elsewhere in the program. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string flip_case(std::string string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_64_vowels_count", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong vowels_count(std::string s) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_64_vowels_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = vowels_count;\n    assert(candidate((\"abcde\")) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((\"Alone\")) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((\"key\")) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((\"bye\")) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((\"keY\")) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((\"bYe\")) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((\"ACEDY\")) == (3));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `filter()` method is then called on this stream to filter out all characters that are not vowels. The `count()` method is then called on the resulting stream to count the number of vowels. The count is stored in the variable `nVowels`. \n\nThe sixth line checks if the last character of the input string `s` is 'y' or 'Y'. If it is, then the number of vowels is incremented by 1. \n\nThe seventh line returns the number of vowels. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively straightforward and can be easily translated to C++. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong vowels_count(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_149_sorted_list_sum", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> sorted_list_sum(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_149_sorted_list_sum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = sorted_list_sum;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"aa\", (std::string)\"a\", (std::string)\"aaa\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"aa\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"school\", (std::string)\"AI\", (std::string)\"asdf\", (std::string)\"b\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"AI\", (std::string)\"asdf\", (std::string)\"school\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"d\", (std::string)\"b\", (std::string)\"c\", (std::string)\"a\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"d\", (std::string)\"dcba\", (std::string)\"abcd\", (std::string)\"a\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"abcd\", (std::string)\"dcba\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"AI\", (std::string)\"ai\", (std::string)\"au\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"AI\", (std::string)\"ai\", (std::string)\"au\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"a\", (std::string)\"b\", (std::string)\"b\", (std::string)\"c\", (std::string)\"c\", (std::string)\"a\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"aaaa\", (std::string)\"bbbb\", (std::string)\"dd\", (std::string)\"cc\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"cc\", (std::string)\"dd\", (std::string)\"aaaa\", (std::string)\"bbbb\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function sorts the input list in ascending order, then creates a new ArrayList and adds all the even-length strings from the input list to the new ArrayList. The new ArrayList is then sorted in ascending order of string length and returned.\n\nThe code imports several libraries: `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various utility classes and functions for working with data structures, reflection, tuples, security, math, and input/output.\n\nThe `class Problem` defines a public static method `sortedListSum` that takes an ArrayList of Strings as input and returns an ArrayList of Strings. The method is static, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe first line of the method sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sort` method of the `ArrayList` class. The `null` argument passed to the `sort` method means that the default ordering of the elements should be used.\n\nThe second line creates a new ArrayList of Strings called `new_lst`.\n\nThe third line starts a `for` loop that iterates over each element `i` in the input list.\n\nThe fourth line checks if the length of the current string `i` is even by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the length is divisible by 2. If the length is even, the current string is added to the `new_lst` ArrayList using the `add` method.\n\nThe fifth line sorts the `new_lst` ArrayList in ascending order of string length using a lambda expression. The lambda expression `(a, b) -> a.length() - b.length()` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and returns the difference between their lengths. This lambda expression is used as an argument to the `sort` method of the `ArrayList` class.\n\nThe last line of the method returns the sorted `new_lst` ArrayList.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> sorted_list_sum(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_101_words_string", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> words_string(std::string s) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_101_words_string.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = words_string;\n    assert(candidate((\"Hi, my name is John\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Hi\", (std::string)\"my\", (std::string)\"name\", (std::string)\"is\", (std::string)\"John\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"One, two, three, four, five, six\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"One\", (std::string)\"two\", (std::string)\"three\", (std::string)\"four\", (std::string)\"five\", (std::string)\"six\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"Hi, my name\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Hi\", (std::string)\"my\", (std::string)\"name\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"One,, two, three, four, five, six,\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"One\", (std::string)\"two\", (std::string)\"three\", (std::string)\"four\", (std::string)\"five\", (std::string)\"six\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((\"ahmed     , gamal\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"ahmed\", (std::string)\"gamal\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `wordsString` and is defined in the `Problem` class.\n\nThe function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty ArrayList.\n\nIf the input string is not empty, the function creates a new ArrayList called `sList`.\n\nThe function then iterates through each character in the input string using a for-each loop. If the character is a comma, the function adds a space to the `sList` ArrayList. Otherwise, the function adds the character as a string to the `sList` ArrayList.\n\nThe function then joins all the strings in the `sList` ArrayList together into a single string using the `String.join` method. The delimiter used for joining is an empty string.\n\nFinally, the function splits the joined string into an ArrayList of strings using the `split` method. The delimiter used for splitting is one or more whitespace characters.\n\nThe function returns the resulting ArrayList of strings.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> words_string(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_107_even_odd_palindrome", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_107_even_odd_palindrome.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = even_odd_palindrome;\n    assert(candidate((123)) == (std::make_tuple(8, 13)));\n    assert(candidate((12)) == (std::make_tuple(4, 6)));\n    assert(candidate((3)) == (std::make_tuple(1, 2)));\n    assert(candidate((63)) == (std::make_tuple(6, 8)));\n    assert(candidate((25)) == (std::make_tuple(5, 6)));\n    assert(candidate((19)) == (std::make_tuple(4, 6)));\n    assert(candidate((9)) == (std::make_tuple(4, 5)));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (std::make_tuple(0, 1)));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The first integer in the pair is the number of even palindromes between 1 and `n`, and the second integer in the pair is the number of odd palindromes between 1 and `n`.\n\nThe function `evenOddPalindrome` takes in a long integer `n` and initializes two long integers `evenPalindromeCount` and `oddPalindromeCount` to 0. It then loops through all the numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and checks if each number is a palindrome and whether it is even or odd. If the number is odd and a palindrome, `oddPalindromeCount` is incremented by 1. If the number is even and a palindrome, `evenPalindromeCount` is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns a pair of `evenPalindromeCount` and `oddPalindromeCount`.\n\nThe function `isPalindrome` takes in a long integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a palindrome. It does this by converting `n` to a string, reversing the string, and comparing the reversed string to the original string. If they are equal, then `n` is a palindrome and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code imports several libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various utilities and classes that are used in the implementation of the `evenOddPalindrome` function and the `isPalindrome` function.\n\nThe code also uses the `Pair` class from the `org.javatuples` library to return a pair of long integers from the `evenOddPalindrome` function. The `Pair` class is a simple tuple class that allows two values of different types to be paired together. In this case, the `Pair` class is used to return two long integers from the `evenOddPalindrome` function. The `Pair.with` method is used to create a new `Pair` object with the `evenPalindromeCount` and `oddPalindromeCount` values as its two elements. \n\nFinally, the code uses the `StringBuilder` class from the `java.lang` library to reverse the string representation of a long integer in the `isPalindrome` function. The `StringBuilder` class provides a convenient way to manipulate strings in Java. The `StringBuilder` class is used to create a new string that is the reverse of the original string representation of `n`. The `toString` method is used to convert the `StringBuilder` object back to a string, which is then compared to the original string representation of `n` using the `equals` method. If the two strings are equal, then `n` is a palindrome. Otherwise, `n` is not a palindrome.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_71_triangle_area", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long b, long c) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_71_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = triangle_area;\n    assert(candidate((3), (4), (5)) == (6.0f));\n    assert(candidate((1), (2), (10)) == (float(-1)));\n    assert(candidate((4), (8), (5)) == (8.18f));\n    assert(candidate((2), (2), (2)) == (1.73f));\n    assert(candidate((1), (2), (3)) == (float(-1)));\n    assert(candidate((10), (5), (7)) == (16.25f));\n    assert(candidate((2), (6), (3)) == (float(-1)));\n    assert(candidate((1), (1), (1)) == (0.43f));\n    assert(candidate((2), (2), (10)) == (float(-1)));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A triangular number is a number that can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers from 1 to n. For example, 6 is a triangular number because it can be represented as 1 + 2 + 3.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is 0. If it is, it returns an ArrayList containing the single value 1L.\n\nIf `n` is not 0, the function initializes an ArrayList called `my_tri` with the first two triangular numbers, 1 and 3.\n\nThe function then loops from 2 to `n`, calculating each triangular number and adding it to `my_tri`. The calculation is done using the formula `term = i % 2 == 0 ? i / 2 + 1 : my_tri.get(i - 1) + my_tri.get(i - 2) + (i + 3) / 2`. This formula uses the ternary operator `? :` to check if `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the formula calculates the triangular number using the formula `i / 2 + 1`. If `i` is odd, the formula calculates the triangular number using the previous two triangular numbers in `my_tri` and the formula `(i + 3) / 2`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the ArrayList `my_tri`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> tri(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_47_median", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat median(std::vector<long> l) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_47_median.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = median;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (float(3)));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-10, (long)4, (long)6, (long)1000, (long)10, (long)20}))) == (8.0f));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5}))) == (float(5)));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)6, (long)5}))) == (5.5f));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)8, (long)1, (long)3, (long)9, (long)9, (long)2, (long)7}))) == (float(7)));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the size is even, it calculates the average of the two middle elements and returns it.\n\nThe `ArrayList` class is a part of the `java.util` package and is used to create dynamic arrays in Java. The `Collections` class is also a part of the `java.util` package and provides utility methods for working with collections, such as sorting.\n\nThe `Math` class is not used in this program, but it is a part of the `java.lang` package and provides mathematical functions and constants.\n\nThe `Method` class is a part of the `java.lang.reflect` package and is used to represent a method of a class or interface. It can be used to invoke the method dynamically at runtime.\n\nThe `Tuple` class is a part of the `org.javatuples` package and provides a way to group multiple objects into a single object. Tuples can be used to return multiple values from a method.\n\nThe `SecureRandom` class is a part of the `java.security` package and provides a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n\nThe `BigInteger` class is a part of the `java.math` package and provides arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.\n\nThe `File` class is a part of the `java.io` package and represents a file or directory on the file system.\n\nThe `Stream` class is a part of the `java.util.stream` package and provides a way to process collections of objects using functional-style operations. It can be used to filter, map, and reduce collections. However, it is not used in this program. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat median(std::vector<long> l) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_44_change_base", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string change_base(long x, long base) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_44_change_base.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = change_base;\n    assert(candidate((8), (3)) == (\"22\"));\n    assert(candidate((9), (3)) == (\"100\"));\n    assert(candidate((234), (2)) == (\"11101010\"));\n    assert(candidate((16), (2)) == (\"10000\"));\n    assert(candidate((8), (2)) == (\"1000\"));\n    assert(candidate((7), (2)) == (\"111\"));\n    assert(candidate((2), (3)) == (\"2\"));\n    assert(candidate((3), (4)) == (\"3\"));\n    assert(candidate((4), (5)) == (\"4\"));\n    assert(candidate((5), (6)) == (\"5\"));\n    assert(candidate((6), (7)) == (\"6\"));\n    assert(candidate((7), (8)) == (\"7\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n\nThe function is called `sortArray` and takes an `ArrayList` of `Long` as its argument. It returns an `ArrayList` of `Long`.\n\nThe function uses the `stream` API to sort the input array. The `sorted` method takes a lambda expression that compares two elements of the array. The lambda expression takes two arguments `a` and `b` of type `Long`. It calculates the number of ones in the binary representation of `a` and `b` using the `Long.bitCount` method. It then compares the counts. If the counts are equal, it compares the values of `a` and `b` using the `Long.compare` method. If the counts are not equal, it compares the counts using the `Integer.compare` method.\n\nThe sorted array is then collected into a new `ArrayList` using the `collect` method and the `Collectors.toCollection` method. The `toCollection` method takes a `Supplier` that creates a new `ArrayList`. The `ArrayList::new` method reference is used to create a new `ArrayList`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_array(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_58_common", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> common(std::vector<long> l1, std::vector<long> l2) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_58_common.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = common;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)3, (long)34, (long)653, (long)2, (long)5})), (std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)7, (long)1, (long)5, (long)9, (long)653, (long)121}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)5, (long)653})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8})), (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)3})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8})), (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)4}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)3, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8})), (std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined as a static method of a class called `Problem`.\n\nThe function first creates a new HashSet of Longs called `set` that contains all the elements of the first input ArrayList `l1`. It then calls the `retainAll` method of `set` with the second input ArrayList `l2` as an argument. This method removes all elements from `set` that are not in `l2`, leaving only the elements that are common to both `l1` and `l2`.\n\nThe function then creates a new ArrayList called `ret` that contains all the elements of `set`. It sorts `ret` using the `Collections.sort` method and returns it. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the code. These libraries include `java.util` (for ArrayList, Set, and HashSet), `java.lang.reflect` (for reflection), `org.javatuples` (for tuples), `java.security` (for security), `java.math` (for mathematical operations), `java.io` (for input and output), and `java.util.stream` (for stream operations). However, none of these libraries are actually used in the `common` function, so they could be removed without affecting the functionality of the code. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. This class contains only one method, the `common` method, which is defined as a static method. A static method is a method that belongs to the class itself, rather than to any particular instance of the class. This means that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class first. \n\nThe `public` keyword is used to specify the access level of the `common` method. This means that the method can be called from outside the class.\n\nThe `ArrayList<Long>` type specifies that the `common` method takes two ArrayLists of Longs as input and returns an ArrayList of Longs as output. The `ArrayList` class is a built-in Java class that represents a dynamic array of objects. The `<Long>` part specifies that the ArrayList contains Long objects.\n\nThe `Set<Long>` type specifies that the `set` variable is a HashSet of Longs. A HashSet is a collection that contains no duplicate elements. The `<Long>` part specifies that the HashSet contains Long objects.\n\nThe `Collections.sort` method is a built-in Java method that sorts a List in ascending order. The `List` interface is a built-in Java interface that represents an ordered collection of elements. The `ArrayList` class implements the `List` interface.\n\nThe `return` keyword is used to return the sorted ArrayList `ret` from the `common` method. \n\nOverall, the `common` method takes two ArrayLists of Longs, finds the elements that are common to both, sorts them in ascending order, and returns them as a new ArrayList. The rest of the code is not used in the `common` method and could be removed without affecting the functionality of the code. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> common(std::vector<long> l1, std::vector<long> l2) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_154_cycpattern_check", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool cycpattern_check(std::string a, std::string b) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_154_cycpattern_check.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = cycpattern_check;\n    assert(candidate((\"xyzw\"), (\"xyw\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"yello\"), (\"ell\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"whattup\"), (\"ptut\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"efef\"), (\"fee\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"abab\"), (\"aabb\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"winemtt\"), (\"tinem\")) == (true));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the second string is a cyclic pattern of the first string. A cyclic pattern is a pattern that can be obtained by rotating the original string any number of times. For example, the string \"abcabc\" is a cyclic pattern of \"abc\" because it can be obtained by rotating \"abc\" twice.\n\nThe function first gets the length of the second string and creates a new string called `pat` by concatenating the second string with itself. This is done to ensure that all possible cyclic patterns of the second string are included in the new string.\n\nThe function then loops through all possible substrings of the first string that have the same length as the second string. For each substring, it checks if it is equal to any of the substrings of `pat`. If a match is found, the function returns `true`. If no match is found, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function is written in Java and uses several built-in Java classes and libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, `java.io.*`, and `java.util.stream.*`.

It also uses Java 8's Stream API to calculate the maximum value of the input ArrayList. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, one would need to replace the ArrayList with a vector, and replace the built-in Java libraries with their C++ equivalents.

The function takes an ArrayList of Long integers as input and returns an ArrayList of Long integers as output. The function is called `sortArray`.\n\nThe function first checks if the input ArrayList is empty. If it is, the function returns a new empty ArrayList.\n\nIf the input ArrayList is not empty, the function determines whether to sort the array in ascending or descending order. It does this by checking if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even or odd. If it is even, the array is sorted in ascending order. If it is odd, the array is sorted in descending order.\n\nThe function then sorts the array using the `Collections.sort` method. If the array was determined to be sorted in descending order, the function reverses the order of the array using the `Collections.reverse` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sorted array. \n\nNote that the code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries are not used in the `sortArray` function, but may be used elsewhere in the code. The code also includes a `main` method, but it is not used in the `sortArray` function and can be ignored. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_array(std::vector<long> array) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_111_histogram", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::map<std::string,long> histogram(std::string test) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_111_histogram.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = histogram;\n    assert(candidate((\"a b b a\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"a\", 2}, {\"b\", 2}})));\n    assert(candidate((\"a b c a b\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"a\", 2}, {\"b\", 2}})));\n    assert(candidate((\"a b c d g\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"a\", 1}, {\"b\", 1}, {\"c\", 1}, {\"d\", 1}, {\"g\", 1}})));\n    assert(candidate((\"r t g\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"r\", 1}, {\"t\", 1}, {\"g\", 1}})));\n    assert(candidate((\"b b b b a\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"b\", 4}})));\n    assert(candidate((\"r t g\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"r\", 1}, {\"t\", 1}, {\"g\", 1}})));\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>()));\n    assert(candidate((\"a\")) == (std::map<std::string,long>({{\"a\", 1}})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe code defines a class called Problem. The class has a static method called getOddCollatz which takes a long integer n as input and returns an ArrayList of long integers. The ArrayList contains all the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from n and ending at 1.\n\nThe method first creates an empty ArrayList called oddCollatz. If n is odd, it adds n to the ArrayList. Then it enters a while loop that continues until n is 1. Inside the while loop, if n is even, it divides n by 2. If n is odd, it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1. If n is odd, it adds n to the ArrayList. After the while loop, the ArrayList is sorted in ascending order and returned.\n\nThe code imports several packages: java.util, java.lang.reflect, org.javatuples, java.security, java.math, java.io, and java.util.stream. These packages provide various classes and methods that are used in the code.\n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and can be easily translated to C++. The main difference between Java and C++ is the syntax, so the logic of the code remains the same. The ArrayList in Java can be replaced with a vector in C++. The while loop and if statements can be written in the same way. The sort method can be replaced with the sort function from the algorithm library in C++. The only major difference is that C++ does not have a built-in package system, so the necessary headers must be included manually. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> get_odd_collatz(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_62_derivative", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> derivative(std::vector<long> xs) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_62_derivative.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = derivative;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)12, (long)20})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)6})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)1, (long)0, (long)4}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2, (long)0, (long)16})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function calculates the derivative of a polynomial represented by the input ArrayList.\n\nThe function is named `derivative` and takes an ArrayList of Longs named `xs` as input. \n\nThe function returns a new ArrayList of Longs that is created by calling the `collect` method on an `IntStream` object. The `IntStream` object is created by calling the `range` method on the `IntStream` class with two arguments: 1 and the size of the input ArrayList. The `range` method returns an `IntStream` object that represents a sequence of integers from 1 to the size of the input ArrayList, exclusive. The `mapToObj` method is then called on the `IntStream` object with a lambda function that takes an integer `i` and returns the product of `i` and the `i`th element of the input ArrayList. The `mapToObj` method returns a new `Stream` object that represents the result of applying the lambda function to each element of the `IntStream` object. The `collect` method is then called on the `Stream` object with an argument that is a method reference to the `ArrayList` constructor that takes no arguments. The `collect` method returns a new `ArrayList` object that contains the result of applying the lambda function to each element of the `IntStream` object.\n\nThe lambda function takes an integer `i` as input and returns the product of `i` and the `i`th element of the input ArrayList. The `get` method is called on the input ArrayList with the integer `i` as argument to get the `i`th element of the ArrayList. The `*` operator is then used to multiply the integer `i` and the `i`th element of the ArrayList. The result of the multiplication is returned as output of the lambda function.\n\nThe `derivative` function calculates the derivative of a polynomial represented by the input ArrayList by multiplying each coefficient of the polynomial by its corresponding power and returning the resulting coefficients as a new ArrayList. For example, if the input ArrayList represents the polynomial `3x^2 + 2x + 1`, the output ArrayList will represent the polynomial `6x + 2`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> derivative(std::vector<long> xs) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_63_fibfib", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fibfib(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_63_fibfib.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = fibfib;\n    assert(candidate((2)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (24));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (81));\n    assert(candidate((12)) == (274));\n    assert(candidate((14)) == (927));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has a single static method called `fibfib`. The method takes a single argument of type `long` and returns a value of type `long`.\n\nThe method is implemented using a ternary operator. The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement. The ternary operator is used to check if the input value is 0, 1, or 2. If the input value is 0 or 1, the method returns 0. If the input value is 2, the method returns 1. If the input value is greater than 2, the method recursively calls itself with the input value decremented by 1, 2, and 3, and returns the sum of the results.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`.

The first element of the pair is the sum of all the numbers in the ArrayList and the second element of the pair is the product of all the numbers in the ArrayList.\n\nThe function is called `sumProduct` and takes in an ArrayList of long integers called `numbers`. \n\nThe function first initializes two long integers called `sum` and `prod` to 0 and 1 respectively. \n\nThe function then iterates through each element in the `numbers` ArrayList using a for-each loop. \n\nFor each element in the `numbers` ArrayList, the function adds the element to the `sum` variable and multiplies the element with the `prod` variable. \n\nAfter iterating through all the elements in the `numbers` ArrayList, the function returns a Pair of long integers using the `Pair.with` method from the `org.javatuples` package. The first element of the Pair is the `sum` variable and the second element of the Pair is the `prod` variable. \n\nThe `Pair` class is a generic class from the `org.javatuples` package that represents a tuple of two elements. The `Pair.with` method is a static method that creates a new Pair object with the specified elements. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import necessary classes and packages that are used in the code. \n\nThe `java.util.*` package is used to import the `ArrayList` class which is used to create an ArrayList of long integers. \n\nThe `java.lang.reflect.*` package is not used in the code and can be removed. \n\nThe `org.javatuples.*` package is used to import the `Pair` class which is used to return a Pair of long integers. \n\nThe `java.security.*` package is not used in the code and can be removed. \n\nThe `java.math.*` package is not used in the code and can be removed. \n\nThe `java.io.*` package is not used in the code and can be removed. \n\nThe `java.util.stream.*` package is not used in the code and can be removed. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. \n\nThe `public static` keywords are used to define a public static method called `sumProduct` that can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the `Problem` class. \n\nThe `Pair<Long, Long>` keywords are used to specify the return type of the `sumProduct` method.

It takes two arguments: an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects called `arr` and a `long` integer called `k`. The function returns a `long` integer.\n\nThe function uses the `stream()` method of the `ArrayList` object to create a stream of the elements in the array. The `limit()` method is then used to limit the stream to the first `k` elements. The `filter()` method is used to filter the elements in the stream based on a condition. The condition is that the length of the string representation of the element (`i.toString().length()`) is less than or equal to 2. The `mapToLong()` method is then used to convert the filtered stream of `Long` objects to a stream of `long` primitives. Finally, the `sum()` method is used to sum the elements in the stream and return the result.\n\nThe code imports several packages at the beginning of the file, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These packages provide various utility classes and methods that are used in the implementation of the `addElements` function. However, none of these packages are actually used in the implementation of the function itself.\n\nOverall, the code is a relatively simple implementation of a function that sums the first `k` elements of an array that have at most two digits. It uses Java's stream API to perform the filtering and summing operations, which makes the code concise and easy to read. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong add_elements(std::vector<long> arr, long k) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_159_eat", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_159_eat.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = eat;\n    assert(candidate((5), (6), (10)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)11, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((4), (8), (9)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)12, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((1), (10), (10)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)11, (long)0})));\n    assert(candidate((2), (11), (5)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)7, (long)0})));\n    assert(candidate((4), (5), (7)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)9, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((4), (5), (1)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)0})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined as a `public static` method of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe function takes in three arguments: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. `number` is a `long` that represents the initial amount of food that a person has. `need` is a `long` that represents the amount of food that the person needs to eat. `remaining` is a `long` that represents the amount of food that the person has left after eating some amount of food.\n\nThe function returns an `ArrayList` of `Long`s that contains two elements: the first element is the amount of food that the person has after eating some amount of food, and the second element is the amount of food that the person has left after eating some amount of food.\n\nThe function first checks if `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`. If it is, then the function creates a new `ArrayList` of `Long`s that contains two elements: `number + need` and `remaining - need`. If `need` is greater than `remaining`, then the function creates a new `ArrayList` of `Long`s that contains two elements: `number + remaining` and `0L`.\n\nThe `ArrayList` is created using the `Arrays.asList` method, which takes in a variable number of arguments and returns a fixed-size `List` backed by the specified array. The `new ArrayList<Long>` constructor is used to create a new `ArrayList` from the `List` returned by `Arrays.asList`.\n\nThe `ArrayList` is returned by the function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_113_odd_count", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> odd_count(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_113_odd_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = odd_count;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"1234567\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"3\", (std::string)\"11111111\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.\", (std::string)\"the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"271\", (std::string)\"137\", (std::string)\"314\"}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.\", (std::string)\"the number of odd elements 3n the str3ng 3 of the 3nput.\", (std::string)\"the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the number of odd digits in each string in the input ArrayList. \n\nThe function starts by creating an empty ArrayList of strings called `res`. \n\nThe function then iterates through each string in the input ArrayList using a for-each loop. \n\nFor each string, the function splits the string into an array of characters using the `split` method and the empty string as a delimiter. The `split` method returns an array of strings, where each string is a single character from the original string. \n\nThe function then uses the `Arrays.stream` method to create a stream of the array of strings. The `filter` method is then used to filter the stream to only include strings that represent odd digits. This is done by converting each string to an integer using `Integer.parseInt` and then checking if the integer is odd using the modulo operator `%`. The `count` method is then used to count the number of elements in the filtered stream. The result is an integer representing the number of odd digits in the original string. \n\nThe function then adds a string to the `res` ArrayList that describes the number of odd digits in the original string. The string includes the number of odd digits, the word \"elements\", the number of odd digits again, the word \"string\", the number of odd digits again, and the word \"of the input\". \n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` ArrayList. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> odd_count(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_90_next_smallest", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<long> next_smallest(std::vector<long> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_90_next_smallest.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = next_smallest;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5}))) == 2);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)1, (long)4, (long)3, (long)2}))) == 2);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == std::nullopt);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1}))) == std::nullopt);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)0}))) == 1);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1}))) == std::nullopt);\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-35, (long)34, (long)12, (long)-45}))) == -35);\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the next smallest element in the ArrayList, if it exists. If it does not exist, the function returns an empty Optional.\n\nThe function is called `nextSmallest` and is defined as a static method of the `Problem` class. The function takes an ArrayList of Longs as its only argument.\n\nThe function uses the `stream()` method of the ArrayList to create a stream of Longs. The stream is then sorted using the `sorted()` method, which sorts the elements in ascending order. The `distinct()` method is then called to remove any duplicates from the stream. The `skip(1)` method is then called to skip the first element in the stream, which is the smallest element. Finally, the `findFirst()` method is called to return the first element in the stream, which is the next smallest element after the smallest element.\n\nThe function returns an Optional Long, which is either empty or contains the next smallest element in the ArrayList. The `Optional` class is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. If the value is present, it can be accessed using the `get()` method of the Optional class. If the value is not present, the `get()` method will throw a `NoSuchElementException`. \n\nThe `Optional` class is used to avoid returning `null` values, which can cause `NullPointerExceptions` if not handled properly. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that are used in the implementation of the `nextSmallest` function. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the function itself.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The `public` keyword is used to specify that the class is accessible from other classes. The `static` keyword is used to specify that the `nextSmallest` method can be called without creating an instance of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe `Optional` class, `ArrayList` class, and `stream()` method are part of the Java 8 Stream API, which provides a functional programming approach to processing collections of data. The Stream API allows for concise and expressive code that is easy to read and understand. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::optional<long> next_smallest(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_87_get_row", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::tuple<long, long>> get_row(std::vector<std::vector<long>> lst, long x) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_87_get_row.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = get_row;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::vector<long>>({(std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)1, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)1})})), (1)) == (std::vector<std::tuple<long, long>>({(std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(0, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(1, 4), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(1, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(2, 5), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(2, 0)})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::vector<long>>({(std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6})})), (2)) == (std::vector<std::tuple<long, long>>({(std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(0, 1), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(1, 1), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(2, 1), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(3, 1), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(4, 1), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(5, 1)})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::vector<long>>({(std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)1, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)1, (long)5, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)1, (long)6}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)1})})), (1)) == (std::vector<std::tuple<long, long>>({(std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(0, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(1, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(2, 1), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(2, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(3, 2), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(3, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(4, 3), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(4, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(5, 4), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(5, 0), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(6, 5), (std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(6, 0)})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::vector<long>>()), (1)) == (std::vector<std::tuple<long, long>>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::vector<long>>({(std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1})})), (2)) == (std::vector<std::tuple<long, long>>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::vector<long>>({(std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>(), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1}), (std::vector<long>)std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3})})), (3)) == (std::vector<std::tuple<long, long>>({(std::tuple<long, long>)std::make_tuple(2, 2)})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Java version\n\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\nclass Problem {\n    public static ArrayList<Pair<Long, Long>> getRow(ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>> lst, long x) {\n        ArrayList<Pair<Long, Long>> coords = new ArrayList<Pair<Long, Long>>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < lst.get(i).size(); j++) {\n                if (lst.get(i).get(j) == x) {\n                    coords.add(new Pair<Long, Long>((long)i, (long)j));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        coords.sort((a, b) -> {\n            if (a.getValue0() == b.getValue0()) {\n                return b.getValue1().compareTo(a.getValue1());\n            }\n            return a.getValue0().compareTo(b.getValue0());\n        });\n        return coords;\n    }\n    \n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `getRow` that takes in a 2D ArrayList of Longs called `lst` and a Long called `x`. The function returns an ArrayList of Pairs of Longs called `coords`. \n\nThe function iterates through each element of `lst` and checks if the element is equal to `x`. If it is, the function creates a new Pair of Longs with the row and column indices of the element and adds it to `coords`. \n\nAfter all elements of `lst` have been checked, the function sorts `coords` in descending order of column index and ascending order of row index. The sorted `coords` is then returned.\n\nThe function does not modify `lst` in any way.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::tuple<long, long>> get_row(std::vector<std::vector<long>> lst, long x) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_29_filter_by_prefix", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> filter_by_prefix(std::vector<std::string> strings, std::string prefix) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_29_filter_by_prefix.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = filter_by_prefix;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>()), (\"john\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"xxx\", (std::string)\"asd\", (std::string)\"xxy\", (std::string)\"john doe\", (std::string)\"xxxAAA\", (std::string)\"xxx\"})), (\"xxx\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"xxx\", (std::string)\"xxxAAA\", (std::string)\"xxx\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It imports several libraries including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. The class has one static method called `filterByPrefix` that takes in an `ArrayList` of `String`s and a `String` called `prefix` as arguments. The method returns a new `ArrayList` of `String`s that start with the `prefix`.\n\nThe method uses Java 8's `Stream` API to filter the input `ArrayList` by checking if each `String` in the list starts with the `prefix`. The `filter` method takes a lambda expression that checks if the `String` starts with the `prefix`. The `collect` method then collects the filtered `String`s into a new `ArrayList` and returns it.\n\nThe `ArrayList` returned by the `filterByPrefix` method is casted to an `ArrayList` of `String`s to avoid a compile-time warning. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> filter_by_prefix(std::vector<std::string> strings, std::string prefix) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_102_choose_num", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong choose_num(long x, long y) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_102_choose_num.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = choose_num;\n    assert(candidate((12), (15)) == (14));\n    assert(candidate((13), (12)) == (-1));\n    assert(candidate((33), (12354)) == (12354));\n    assert(candidate((5234), (5233)) == (-1));\n    assert(candidate((6), (29)) == (28));\n    assert(candidate((27), (10)) == (-1));\n    assert(candidate((7), (7)) == (-1));\n    assert(candidate((546), (546)) == (546));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a number based on the values of `x` and `y` according to the following rules:\n\n1. If `x` is greater than `y`, return -1.\n2. If `y` is even, return `y`.\n3. If `x` is equal to `y`, return -1.\n4. Otherwise, return `y - 1`.\n\nThe function is defined as a static method of a class called `Problem`. The class imports several packages, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. The `java.util` package provides the `Scanner` class for reading input from the console, the `ArrayList` class for storing a list of objects, and the `Arrays` class for working with arrays. The `java.lang.reflect` package provides classes and interfaces for obtaining information about objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples` package provides classes for working with tuples, which are fixed-length sequences of objects. The `java.security` package provides classes for implementing security algorithms and protocols. The `java.math` package provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io` package provides classes for working with files and streams.\n\nThe `chooseNum` method is a simple implementation that checks the input values and returns a result based on the rules described above. The method does not use any of the imported packages. Therefore, the imports are not necessary for the implementation of the method. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong choose_num(long x, long y) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_82_prime_length", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool prime_length(std::string string) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_82_prime_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = prime_length;\n    assert(candidate((\"Hello\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcdcba\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"kittens\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"orange\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"wow\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"world\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"MadaM\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"Wow\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"HI\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"go\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"gogo\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"Madam\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"M\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"0\")) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This class has one public static method called `primeLength` that takes a `String` as an argument and returns a `boolean`. The method determines whether the length of the input string is a prime number or not. \n\nThe first line of the program imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that can be used in the program.\n\nThe second line of the program defines the `Problem` class.\n\nThe third line of the program defines the `primeLength` method. The method takes a `String` argument called `string`.\n\nThe fourth line of the program declares an integer variable called `l` and assigns it the length of the input string.\n\nThe fifth line of the program checks if the length of the input string is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the method returns `false`.\n\nThe sixth line of the program starts a `for` loop that iterates over the integers from 2 to `l - 1`. \n\nThe seventh line of the program checks if `l` is divisible by the current integer in the loop. If it is, the method returns `false`.\n\nThe eighth line of the program returns `true` if the loop completes without returning `false`.\n\nThe code uses several Java libraries and features, including the `String` class, `if` statements, `for` loops, and the modulo operator `%`. To rewrite this program in C++, you would need to use the equivalent C++ libraries and syntax. For example, you could use the `std::string` class instead of `String`, and the `for` loop syntax in C++ is slightly different than in Java. However, the basic logic of the program would remain the same. \n\nHere is an example of what the C++ code might look like:\n\n```\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool prime_length(std::string string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_60_sum_to_n", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong sum_to_n(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_60_sum_to_n.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = sum_to_n;\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((6)) == (21));\n    assert(candidate((11)) == (66));\n    assert(candidate((30)) == (465));\n    assert(candidate((100)) == (5050));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `sumToN` and takes a single argument `n` of type `long`. The function returns a value of type `long`.\n\nThe function calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of all numbers from 1 to n is equal to the sum of the first and last number, multiplied by the number of pairs of numbers. Since the first and last number are 1 and n respectively, the sum is `(1 + n) * n / 2`.\n\nThe code imports several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`.

However, if there are more than two consecutive spaces, the function replaces them with a single hyphen. \n\nThe function is called `fixSpaces` and takes in a single parameter `text` of type `String`. \n\nThe first line of the function initializes a new string `newText` to an empty string. \n\nThe next three lines initialize three integer variables `i`, `start`, and `end` to 0. \n\nThe next line starts a while loop that runs as long as `i` is less than the length of the input string `text`. \n\nThe next line checks if the character at index `i` of `text` is a space. If it is, the `end` variable is incremented. \n\nIf the character at index `i` of `text` is not a space, the function checks if there are more than two consecutive spaces between the current character and the previous non-space character. If there are, the function adds a hyphen followed by the current character to `newText`. If there are less than or equal to two consecutive spaces, the function adds underscores equal to the number of spaces between the current character and the previous non-space character, followed by the current character to `newText`. If there are no spaces between the current character and the previous non-space character, the function simply adds the current character to `newText`. \n\nAfter adding the current character to `newText`, the `start` and `end` variables are updated to the current index plus one. \n\nThe last two lines of the while loop check if there are any remaining spaces at the end of the input string. If there are more than two consecutive spaces, the function adds a hyphen to `newText`. If there are less than or equal to two consecutive spaces, the function adds underscores equal to the number of spaces to `newText`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the modified `newText` string. \n\nThe code imports several libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, `java.io`, and `java.util.stream`.

The function is called `wordsInSentence` and takes a single argument `sentence` of type `String`. The function returns a string that is the result of processing the input string.\n\nThe function starts by creating a new empty list of strings called `newLst`. This list will be used to store the words that pass the filtering criteria.\n\nThe function then iterates over each word in the input string. This is done by splitting the input string into words using the space character as a delimiter. The `split` method of the `String` class is used to split the input string into an array of words.\n\nFor each word, the function checks if the length of the word is 1 or if the length of the word is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If either of these conditions is true, the word is skipped and the function moves on to the next word. Otherwise, the word is added to the `newLst` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns a string that is the result of joining the words in the `newLst` list with a space character as a delimiter. The `join` method of the `String` class is used to join the words in the list into a single string. If the list is empty, an empty string is returned.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string words_in_sentence(std::string sentence) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_118_get_closest_vowel", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string get_closest_vowel(std::string word) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_118_get_closest_vowel.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = get_closest_vowel;\n    assert(candidate((\"yogurt\")) == (\"u\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"full\")) == (\"u\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"easy\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"eAsy\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"ali\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"bad\")) == (\"a\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"most\")) == (\"o\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"ab\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"ba\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"quick\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"anime\")) == (\"i\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"Asia\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"Above\")) == (\"o\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `compare` and takes two arguments, `game` and `guess`. The function returns a list of the absolute difference between each element of `game` and `guess`. \n\nThe function is defined in a class called `Problem`. The class has no other methods or attributes. \n\nThe function is defined as `public static`. This means that it can be accessed from outside the class and that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. \n\nThe function returns an `ArrayList<Long>`. This is a list of Longs. \n\nThe function takes two arguments, both of which are `ArrayList<Long>`. This means that the function expects two lists of Longs. \n\nThe function uses the `IntStream` class to iterate over the indices of the `game` list. The `IntStream` class is part of the Java 8 Stream API and provides a way to iterate over a range of integers. The `range` method of the `IntStream` class is used to create a stream of integers from 0 to the size of the `game` list. \n\nThe `mapToObj` method of the `IntStream` class is used to map each integer in the stream to an object. In this case, each integer is mapped to the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the `game` and `guess` lists. \n\nThe `collect` method of the `Stream` class is used to collect the mapped objects into a list. The `Collectors.toList()` method is used to create an `ArrayList` of the mapped objects. \n\nThe resulting list is returned by the function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> compare(std::vector<long> game, std::vector<long> guess) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_26_remove_duplicates", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> remove_duplicates(std::vector<long> numbers) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_26_remove_duplicates.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = remove_duplicates;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)2, (long)4, (long)3, (long)5}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)5})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all the numbers in the string `s`.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `sum` to 0. It then loops through each element in the array returned by splitting the string `s` on whitespace. For each element `i`, it checks if it matches the regular expression `\\\\d+`, which matches one or more digits. If it does, it converts `i` to a long integer using `Long.parseLong` and adds it to `sum`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the difference between `n` and `sum`. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also includes a `Problem` class, which contains the `fruitDistribution` function. The `main` method is not included in this code snippet. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and should be straightforward to translate to C++. The main challenge may be finding equivalent libraries and functions in C++. For example, the `split` method used on a string in Java does not exist in C++, so an alternative approach would need to be used. Additionally, the regular expression syntax may be slightly different in C++ compared to Java. However, the basic logic of the function should be easy to understand and translate. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fruit_distribution(std::string s, long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_11_string_xor", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string string_xor(std::string a, std::string b) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_11_string_xor.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = string_xor;\n    assert(candidate((\"111000\"), (\"101010\")) == (\"010010\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"1\"), (\"1\")) == (\"0\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"0101\"), (\"0000\")) == (\"0101\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has one public static method called `stringSequence` that takes a long integer `n` as input and returns a string. \n\nThe method returns a string that is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. The sequence starts from 0 and ends at `n`. \n\nThe method uses the `LongStream` class from the `java.util.stream` package to generate a stream of long integers from 0 to `n`. The `mapToObj` method is then called on the stream to convert each long integer to a string using the `Long::toString` method. Finally, the `collect` method is called on the stream to join all the strings together with a space separator using the `Collectors.joining` method. \n\nThe resulting string is then returned by the method. \n\nThe code imports several packages including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`.

A valid file name is defined as follows:\n\n- The file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` is a string of letters and digits and `extension` is one of the strings \"txt\", \"exe\", or \"dll\".\n- The length of `name` is at most 3.\n- The first character of `name` is a letter.\n\nThe function first defines two arrays `suf` and `lst`. `suf` contains the valid file extensions, and `lst` is the result of splitting `file_name` on the period character. If the resulting array `lst` does not have exactly two elements, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function then checks if the second element of `lst` is a valid file extension by checking if it is contained in the `suf` array. If it is not, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function then checks if the first character of the first element of `lst` is a letter. If it is not, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function then counts the number of digits in the first element of `lst` by removing all non-digits from the string and counting the length of the resulting string. If this count is greater than 3, the function returns \"No\".\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, the function returns \"Yes\". \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string file_name_check(std::string file_name) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_135_can_arrange", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong can_arrange(std::vector<long> arr) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_135_can_arrange.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = can_arrange;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)3, (long)5}))) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (-1));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)2, (long)5, (long)6, (long)7, (long)8, (long)9, (long)10}))) == (2));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)8, (long)5, (long)7, (long)3}))) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (-1));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes an ArrayList of two strings as input and returns \"Yes\" if the two strings are balanced and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe function `matchParens` takes an ArrayList of two strings `lst` as input. The two strings are concatenated and passed to the function `check` which checks if the parentheses in the concatenated string are balanced or not. If the parentheses are balanced, the function returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, the two strings are concatenated in reverse order and passed to the function `check` again. If the parentheses are balanced in this case, the function returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function `check` takes a string `s` as input and checks if the parentheses in the string are balanced or not. The function returns `true` if the parentheses are balanced and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function `check` works as follows. It initializes a variable `val` to 0. It then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is an opening parenthesis, `val` is incremented by 1. If the character is a closing parenthesis, `val` is decremented by 1. If `val` becomes negative at any point, the function returns `false` because the parentheses are not balanced. If the iteration completes and `val` is 0, the function returns `true` because the parentheses are balanced. Otherwise, the function returns `false` because the parentheses are not balanced.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string match_parens(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> filter_by_substring(std::vector<std::string> strings, std::string substring) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = filter_by_substring;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>()), (\"john\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"xxx\", (std::string)\"asd\", (std::string)\"xxy\", (std::string)\"john doe\", (std::string)\"xxxAAA\", (std::string)\"xxx\"})), (\"xxx\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"xxx\", (std::string)\"xxxAAA\", (std::string)\"xxx\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"xxx\", (std::string)\"asd\", (std::string)\"aaaxxy\", (std::string)\"john doe\", (std::string)\"xxxAAA\", (std::string)\"xxx\"})), (\"xx\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"xxx\", (std::string)\"aaaxxy\", (std::string)\"xxxAAA\", (std::string)\"xxx\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"grunt\", (std::string)\"trumpet\", (std::string)\"prune\", (std::string)\"gruesome\"})), (\"run\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"grunt\", (std::string)\"prune\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The method takes in an ArrayList of strings called `strings` and a string called `substring`. The method returns an ArrayList of strings that contain the given substring. \n\nThe method uses Java's stream API to filter the list of strings. The `stream` method is called on the `strings` ArrayList, which creates a stream of the elements in the list. The `filter` method is then called on the stream, which takes in a lambda expression that checks if each element in the stream contains the given substring. The `collect` method is then called on the filtered stream, which collects the filtered elements into a new ArrayList. The `toCollection` method is used to specify the type of collection to create, which in this case is an ArrayList. Finally, the `new` keyword is used to create a new instance of the ArrayList.\n\nOverall, the code is a concise and efficient implementation of a common programming task. It demonstrates the power of Java's stream API and the ease of working with collections in Java. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> filter_by_substring(std::vector<std::string> strings, std::string substring) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_158_find_max", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string find_max(std::vector<std::string> words) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_158_find_max.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = find_max;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"name\", (std::string)\"of\", (std::string)\"string\"}))) == (\"string\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"name\", (std::string)\"enam\", (std::string)\"game\"}))) == (\"enam\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"aaaaaaa\", (std::string)\"bb\", (std::string)\"cc\"}))) == (\"aaaaaaa\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"abc\", (std::string)\"cba\"}))) == (\"abc\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"play\", (std::string)\"this\", (std::string)\"game\", (std::string)\"of\", (std::string)\"footbott\"}))) == (\"footbott\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"we\", (std::string)\"are\", (std::string)\"gonna\", (std::string)\"rock\"}))) == (\"gonna\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"we\", (std::string)\"are\", (std::string)\"a\", (std::string)\"mad\", (std::string)\"nation\"}))) == (\"nation\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"this\", (std::string)\"is\", (std::string)\"a\", (std::string)\"prrk\"}))) == (\"this\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"b\"}))) == (\"b\"));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"play\", (std::string)\"play\", (std::string)\"play\"}))) == (\"play\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `solve` and it takes a single argument, a string called `s`. The function returns a string.\n\nThe function first initializes two integer variables, `flg` and `idx`, to 0. It then converts the input string `s` into a character array called `newStr`. The `for` loop iterates over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, the code checks if it is a letter using the `Character.isLetter()` method. If the character is a letter, the code toggles its case (i.e., if it is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase, and vice versa) and stores the result in the corresponding position in the `newStr` array. The `flg` variable is set to 1 to indicate that at least one letter has been modified. The `idx` variable is incremented to keep track of the current position in the `newStr` array.\n\nAfter the `for` loop completes, the code checks if any letters were modified by checking the value of the `flg` variable. If no letters were modified, the code returns the reverse of the input string using the `StringBuilder.reverse()` method. If at least one letter was modified, the code returns the modified string by converting the `newStr` array back to a string using the `String` constructor. \n\nThe code uses several Java libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `solve` function. The `java.util.stream.*` library is imported but not used at all. \n\nOverall, the `solve` function takes an input string and returns a modified version of the string where all letters have been toggled in case. If no letters were modified, the function returns the reverse of the input string. The function is implemented using a `for` loop that iterates over each character in the input string and toggles the case of each letter. The function uses several Java libraries, but none of them are actually used in the implementation of the function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string solve(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_157_right_angle_triangle", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool right_angle_triangle(long a, long b, long c) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_157_right_angle_triangle.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = right_angle_triangle;\n    assert(candidate((3), (4), (5)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((1), (2), (3)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((10), (6), (8)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((2), (2), (2)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((7), (24), (25)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((10), (5), (7)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((5), (12), (13)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((15), (8), (17)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((48), (55), (73)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((1), (1), (1)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((2), (2), (10)) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The method returns `true` if the three arguments form a right-angled triangle, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe method checks if the square of one of the arguments is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two arguments. If this is true for any of the three combinations of arguments, then the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe code imports several Java packages, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`.

To rewrite the code in C++, one would need to replace the `long` data type with the appropriate C++ data type, and implement the `rightAngleTriangle` method using C++ syntax.

The `public static` keywords are used to define a public static method called `doubleTheDifference` that takes an ArrayList of Floats called `lst` as input and returns a long.\n\nThe body of the `doubleTheDifference` function is a single line of code that uses the `stream()` method of the ArrayList class to create a stream of the input ArrayList. The `filter()` method is then used to filter the stream to only include elements that are greater than 0, odd, and equal to their floor value. The `mapToLong()` method is then used to square each of the filtered elements and convert them to longs. Finally, the `sum()` method is used to sum up all of the squared elements in the stream.

The ArrayList contains the first n terms of a sequence where the even terms are the factorials of the term number and the odd terms are the sum of the numbers from 1 to the term number. \n\nThe function is defined as `public static ArrayList<Long> f(long n)`. It takes in a long integer n and returns an ArrayList of long integers.\n\nThe ArrayList is initialized as an empty ArrayList of Longs using `ArrayList<Long> ret = new ArrayList<Long>();`.\n\nThe function then loops from 1 to n using `for (long i=1; i<=n; i++)`. \n\nFor each iteration of the loop, the function checks if the current term number is even using `if (i%2 == 0)`. If it is even, the function calculates the factorial of the term number using `long x = 1; for (long j=1; j<=i; j++) x *= j;` and adds it to the ArrayList using `ret.add(x);`.\n\nIf the current term number is odd, the function calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to the term number using `long x = 0; for (long j=1; j<=i; j++) x += j;` and adds it to the ArrayList using `ret.add(x);`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the ArrayList using `return ret;`. \n\nNote that the code imports several libraries at the beginning of the file, but they are not used in the implementation of the function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> f(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_57_monotonic", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool monotonic(std::vector<long> l) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_57_monotonic.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = monotonic;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)10}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)20}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)20, (long)4, (long)10}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)1, (long)0, (long)-10}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)1, (long)1, (long)0}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)2, (long)5, (long)60}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)60}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)9, (long)9, (long)9, (long)9}))) == (true));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the ArrayList is monotonic, which means that the elements in the list are either all increasing or all decreasing.\n\nThe function first checks if the ArrayList is sorted in increasing order or decreasing order using the `equals` method of the ArrayList class. The `equals` method is used to compare two ArrayLists for equality. The `sorted` method of the Stream class is used to sort the ArrayList in either increasing or decreasing order. The `collect` method of the Stream class is used to collect the sorted elements into a new ArrayList.\n\nIf the ArrayList is sorted in either increasing or decreasing order, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe function is declared as `public static` which means that it can be called from other classes without creating an instance of the class.

The function sorts the input array in descending order and then converts each integer in the array to its corresponding string representation (e.g. 1 becomes \"One\", 2 becomes \"Two\", etc.) if it is between 1 and 9 inclusive. The resulting array of strings is then returned.\n\nThe function uses several Java libraries, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These libraries provide various utilities for working with collections, reflection, tuples, security, math, and input/output.\n\nThe `ArrayList` class is used to represent the input and output arrays. The `String` and `Long` classes are used to represent the elements of the arrays. The `Comparator` and `Collectors` classes are used to sort and collect the elements of the input array, respectively.\n\nThe `String[] dic` array is used to map integers to their corresponding string representations. The `sortedArr` array is a sorted copy of the input array. The `newArr` array is used to store the resulting string representations of the integers in the input array.\n\nThe `for` loop iterates over the elements of the `sortedArr` array. If an element is between 1 and 9 inclusive, its corresponding string representation is added to the `newArr` array using the `add` method. Finally, the `newArr` array is returned.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> by_length(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_51_remove_vowels", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string remove_vowels(std::string text) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_51_remove_vowels.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = remove_vowels;\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcdef\\nghijklm\")) == (\"bcdf\\nghjklm\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"fedcba\")) == (\"fdcb\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"eeeee\")) == (\"\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"acBAA\")) == (\"cB\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"EcBOO\")) == (\"cB\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"ybcd\")) == (\"ybcd\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Java version\n\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\nclass Problem {\n    public static boolean iscube(long a) {\n        a = Math.abs(a);\n        return Math.pow(Math.round(Math.cbrt(a)), 3) == a;\n    }\n    \n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that checks if a given number is a perfect cube. \n\nThe function is called `iscube` and takes a single argument of type `long`. \n\nThe first line of the function sets the value of the argument to its absolute value using the `Math.abs` function. \n\nThe second line of the function calculates the cube root of the absolute value of the argument using the `Math.cbrt` function. The `Math.round` function is then called on the result of the cube root calculation to round it to the nearest integer. This rounded value is then cubed using the `Math.pow` function with an exponent of 3. \n\nThe third line of the function checks if the cubed value is equal to the absolute value of the original argument. If it is, the function returns `true`, indicating that the original argument is a perfect cube. If it is not, the function returns `false`, indicating that the original argument is not a perfect cube. \n\nThe code imports several Java libraries at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. It also includes a `Problem` class that contains the `iscube` function. \n\nThe code also includes a `main` function, which is not used in this implementation. \n\nFinally, the code uses Java 8 streams to perform some operations on collections of data. However, these operations are not related to the `iscube` function and are not necessary for its implementation. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool iscube(long a) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_112_reverse_delete", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<std::string, bool> reverse_delete(std::string s, std::string c) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_112_reverse_delete.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = reverse_delete;\n    assert(candidate((\"abcde\"), (\"ae\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"bcd\", false)));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcdef\"), (\"b\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"acdef\", false)));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcdedcba\"), (\"ab\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"cdedc\", true)));\n    assert(candidate((\"dwik\"), (\"w\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"dik\", false)));\n    assert(candidate((\"a\"), (\"a\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"\", true)));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcdedcba\"), (\"\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"abcdedcba\", true)));\n    assert(candidate((\"abcdedcba\"), (\"v\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"abcdedcba\", true)));\n    assert(candidate((\"vabba\"), (\"v\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"abba\", true)));\n    assert(candidate((\"mamma\"), (\"mia\")) == (std::make_tuple(\"\", true)));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It is a simple class that holds two values of different types. In this case, the `Pair` object holds a string and a boolean value.\n\nThe `reverseDelete` function first filters out all characters in the input string `s` that are also present in the input string `c`. This is done using the `chars()` method which returns an `IntStream` of the characters in the string, the `filter()` method which removes all characters that are present in the string `c`, the `mapToObj()` method which converts the integer values back to characters, and the `collect()` method which joins all the characters back into a string.\n\nThe resulting string is then checked to see if it is a palindrome. This is done by creating a new `StringBuilder` object from the string, reversing it, and then comparing it to the original string using the `equals()` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns a `Pair` object containing the filtered string and a boolean value indicating whether or not the filtered string is a palindrome. \n\nNote that the program imports several other packages such as `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. However, these packages are not actually used in the program and can be safely removed. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<std::string, bool> reverse_delete(std::string s, std::string c) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_4_mean_absolute_deviation", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat mean_absolute_deviation(std::vector<float> numbers) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_4_mean_absolute_deviation.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = mean_absolute_deviation;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f}))) == (0.5f));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f}))) == (1.0f));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f}))) == (1.2f));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The stream() method creates a stream of the elements in the ArrayList, which can be operated on using various methods. The reduce() method is used to sum up all the elements in the stream. The first argument to reduce() is the starting value of the sum, which is 0.0f. The second argument is a lambda expression that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. This is equivalent to the static method Float.sum(a, b). The result of the reduce() method is divided by the size of the ArrayList to get the mean.\n\nThe second line of the function calculates the mean absolute deviation of the numbers. The map() method is used to create a new stream of the absolute differences between each element of the ArrayList and the mean. The reduce() method is then used to sum up all the elements in the stream. The first argument to reduce() is the starting value of the sum, which is 0.0f. The second argument is a lambda expression that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. This is equivalent to the static method Float.sum(a, b). The result of the reduce() method is divided by the size of the ArrayList to get the mean absolute deviation. \n\nThe function returns the mean absolute deviation. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace ArrayList with a vector<float>, and use the accumulate() function instead of the reduce() method. The lambda expressions would need to be replaced with function objects or lambdas. The Math.abs() method would need to be replaced with the abs() function from the cmath library. The stream() method would need to be replaced with a range-based for loop. \n\nHere is an example of what the C++ code might look like:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat mean_absolute_deviation(std::vector<float> numbers) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_56_correct_bracketing", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_56_correct_bracketing.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = correct_bracketing;\n    assert(candidate((\"<>\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"<<><>>\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"<><><<><>><>\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"<><><<<><><>><>><<><><<>>>\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"<<<><>>>>\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"><<>\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"<\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"<<<<\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\">\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"<<>\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"<><><<><>><>><<>\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"<><><<><>><>>><>\")) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It then iterates over each character in the string using a for-each loop. \n\nFor each character, it checks if it is an opening bracket (in this case, '<'). If it is, it increments the `depth` variable. If it is a closing bracket, it decrements the `depth` variable. \n\nIf at any point the `depth` variable becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns false. \n\nAfter iterating over all the characters in the string, if the `depth` variable is 0, it means that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. \n\nThe function is written in Java and uses several built-in Java classes and libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, `java.io.*`, and `java.util.stream.*`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `correctBracketing` function. \n\nThe function could be rewritten in C++ as follows:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_21_rescale_to_unit", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<float> rescale_to_unit(std::vector<float> numbers) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_21_rescale_to_unit.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = rescale_to_unit;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)2.0f, (float)49.9f}))) == (std::vector<float>({(float)0.0f, (float)1.0f})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)100.0f, (float)49.9f}))) == (std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)0.0f})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f}))) == (std::vector<float>({(float)0.0f, (float)0.25f, (float)0.5f, (float)0.75f, (float)1.0f})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)2.0f, (float)1.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f}))) == (std::vector<float>({(float)0.25f, (float)0.0f, (float)1.0f, (float)0.5f, (float)0.75f})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)12.0f, (float)11.0f, (float)15.0f, (float)13.0f, (float)14.0f}))) == (std::vector<float>({(float)0.25f, (float)0.0f, (float)1.0f, (float)0.5f, (float)0.75f})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a string.\n\nThe first line of the function calculates the left endpoint of the intersection of the two intervals. It does this by taking the maximum of the left endpoints of the two intervals. The `getValue0()` method is used to extract the left endpoint from each interval.\n\nThe second line of the function calculates the right endpoint of the intersection of the two intervals. It does this by taking the minimum of the right endpoints of the two intervals. The `getValue1()` method is used to extract the right endpoint from each interval.\n\nThe third line of the function calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals. It does this by subtracting the left endpoint from the right endpoint.\n\nThe fourth line of the function checks if the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and is a prime number. It does this by calling the `isPrime` function, which takes a long integer as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is prime or not.\n\nThe `isPrime` function is a private helper function that takes a long integer as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is prime or not. The function first checks if the number is 1 or 0, in which case it returns false. It then checks if the number is 2, in which case it returns true. Otherwise, it checks if the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and n-1, inclusive. If it is, the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.\n\nThe rest of the code is just imports and boilerplate. The `Pair` class is used to represent pairs of long integers. The `Math` class is used for mathematical operations. The `java.util.*` package is used for various utility classes. The `java.lang.reflect.*` package is used for reflection. The `java.security.*` package is used for security-related classes. The `java.math.*` package is used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The `java.io.*` package is used for input/output operations. The `java.util.stream.*` package is used for stream processing.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Java version\n\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\nclass Problem {\n    public static long hexKey(String num) {\n        String primes = \"2357BD\";\n        long total = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {\n            if (primes.indexOf(num.charAt(i)) >= 0) {\n                total++;\n            }\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a Java class called `Problem`. The class has a single static method called `hexKey` that takes a string parameter called `num` and returns a `long` value.\n\nThe `hexKey` method calculates the number of times a character in the input string `num` appears in the string \"2357BD\". It does this by iterating over each character in the input string and checking if it appears in the string \"2357BD\". If it does, it increments a counter variable called `total`. After iterating over all characters in the input string, the method returns the value of `total`.\n\nThe `hexKey` method is declared as `public static`, which means that it can be called from other classes without needing to create an instance of the `Problem` class. The `long` return type indicates that the method returns a 64-bit integer value.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various Java classes and packages that are used in the `Problem` class. These include:\n\n- `java.util.*`: This imports the `java.util` package, which contains various utility classes and interfaces, such as the `Scanner` class for reading input from the console.\n- `java.lang.reflect.*`: This imports the `java.lang.reflect` package, which provides classes and interfaces for obtaining information about classes and objects at runtime.\n- `org.javatuples.*`: This imports the `org.javatuples` package, which provides a tuple data structure for storing multiple values of different types.\n- `java.security.*`: This imports the `java.security` package, which provides classes and interfaces for security-related operations, such as generating cryptographic keys and signing data.\n- `java.math.*`: This imports the `java.math` package, which provides classes for performing arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n- `java.io.*`: This imports the `java.io` package, which provides classes for performing input and output operations, such as reading and writing files.\n- `java.util.stream.*`: This imports the `java.util.stream` package, which provides classes and interfaces for processing streams of data.\n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The class contains a single method called `hexKey`, which is declared as `public static long`. The `public` keyword means that the method can be accessed from outside the class, while the `static` keyword means that the method can be called without needing to create an instance of the `Problem` class.\n\nThe `long` return type indicates that the method returns a 64-bit integer value. The method takes a single parameter called `num`, which is of type `String`.\n\nThe body of the `hexKey` method contains a `for` loop that iterates over each character in the input string `num`. The loop uses the `charAt` method of the `String` class to get the character at the current index, and then checks if the character appears in the string \"2357BD\" using the `indexOf` method of the `String` class. If the character appears in the string, the `total` variable is incremented.\n\nAfter the loop has finished iterating over all characters in the input string, the method returns the value of the `total` variable.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong hex_key(std::string num) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_70_strange_sort_list", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> strange_sort_list(std::vector<long> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_70_strange_sort_list.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = strange_sort_list;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)2, (long)3})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)6, (long)7, (long)8, (long)9}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)9, (long)6, (long)8, (long)7})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)5, (long)2, (long)4, (long)3})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)6, (long)7, (long)8, (long)9, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)9, (long)5, (long)8, (long)6, (long)7})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)5, (long)5, (long)5}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)5, (long)5, (long)5})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6, (long)7, (long)8}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)8, (long)2, (long)7, (long)3, (long)6, (long)4, (long)5})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)2, (long)2, (long)2, (long)5, (long)5, (long)-5, (long)-5}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)-5, (long)5, (long)-5, (long)5, (long)0, (long)2, (long)2, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)111111}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)111111})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Collections.min(lst) : Collections.max(lst));\n            lst.remove(res.get(res.size() - 1));\n            switch_ = !switch_;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that sorts an array of long integers in a strange way. The function is called `strangeSortList` and takes an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects as input. It returns another `ArrayList` of `Long` objects that is sorted in a strange way.\n\nThe function works by iterating over the input list and adding the smallest or largest element to the output list depending on whether a boolean variable `switch_` is true or false. The `switch_` variable is toggled at each iteration, so that the function alternates between adding the smallest and largest elements to the output list.\n\nThe `Collections.min` and `Collections.max` methods are used to find the smallest and largest elements in the input list, respectively. The `remove` method is used to remove the element that was added to the output list from the input list.\n\nThe function continues iterating over the input list until it is empty, at which point the output list contains all the elements of the input list sorted in a strange way.\n\nThe `ArrayList` class is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a resizable array implementation. The `Boolean` class is a wrapper class for the primitive type `boolean`. The `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import classes from other packages and make them available in the current code.\n\nThe `public` keyword indicates that the function is accessible from other classes. The `static` keyword indicates that the function belongs to the class and not to an instance of the class. The `void` keyword indicates that the function does not return a value. The `class` keyword is used to define a new class named `Problem`.\n\nThe `main` method is not present in this code, but it is the entry point for Java programs and is used to start the execution of the program. The `args` parameter is an array of strings that contains the command-line arguments passed to the program. The `System.out.println` method is used to print output to the console. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the console. The `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program. The `Math` class provides methods for mathematical operations. The `String` class is used to represent strings of characters. The `if-else` statement is used to conditionally execute code. The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute code while a condition is true. The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the code at least once before checking the condition. The `switch` statement is used to conditionally execute code based on the value of a variable. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement. The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object. The `super` keyword is used to refer to the parent class. The `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass of a class. The `implements` keyword is used to implement an interface. The `interface` keyword is used to define an interface. The `abstract` keyword is used to define an abstract class or method. The `final` keyword is used to indicate that a variable or method cannot be modified. The `static` keyword is used to indicate that a variable or method belongs to the class and not to an instance of the class. The `transient` keyword is used to indicate that a variable should\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> strange_sort_list(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_91_is_bored", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong is_bored(std::string S) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_91_is_bored.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_bored;\n    assert(candidate((\"Hello world\")) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((\"Is the sky blue?\")) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((\"I love It !\")) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((\"bIt\")) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((\"I feel good today.

The pattern matches a period, exclamation mark, or question mark, followed by zero or more spaces. \n\nThe function then returns the number of sentences in the `sentences` array that start with the substring \"I \". This is done using the `Arrays.stream` method to create a stream of sentences, and then using the `filter` method to keep only the sentences that start with \"I \". Finally, the `count` method is used to count the number of sentences that remain in the stream. \n\nThe purpose of the function is to count the number of sentences in the input string that start with \"I \", which could be an indication that the speaker is bored. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong is_bored(std::string S) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_14_all_prefixes", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> all_prefixes(std::string string) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_14_all_prefixes.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = all_prefixes;\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((\"asdfgh\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"a\", (std::string)\"as\", (std::string)\"asd\", (std::string)\"asdf\", (std::string)\"asdfg\", (std::string)\"asdfgh\"})));\n    assert(candidate((\"WWW\")) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"W\", (std::string)\"WW\", (std::string)\"WWW\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The method is declared as `public` and `static`, which means it can be called from outside the class without an instance of the class, and it does not require an instance of the class to be created in order to be called.\n- `return IntStream.range(0, lst.size()).filter(i -> i%2==0 && lst.get(i)%2==1).mapToLong(i -> lst.get(i)).sum();` returns the sum of all the odd numbers at even indices in the ArrayList. \n\n  - `IntStream.range(0, lst.size())` creates a stream of integers from 0 to the size of the ArrayList.\n  - `.filter(i -> i%2==0 && lst.get(i)%2==1)` filters the stream to only include even indices where the corresponding element in the ArrayList is odd.\n  - `.mapToLong(i -> lst.get(i))` maps the filtered stream to a stream of longs, where each element is the corresponding element in the ArrayList at the given index.\n  - `.sum()` calculates the sum of all the elements in the stream and returns it as a long. \n\nOverall, the `solution` method is a concise way to calculate the sum of all the odd numbers at even indices in an ArrayList of Longs using Java's stream API. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong solution(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_126_is_sorted", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_sorted(std::vector<long> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_126_is_sorted.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_sorted;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6, (long)7}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6, (long)7}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)1}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)2, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)3, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)2, (long)3, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (true));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `search`. \n\nThe first line of the function creates a new array of longs called `frq` with a length of the maximum value in the input ArrayList plus one. \n\n```java\nlong[] frq = new long[Collections.max(lst).intValue() + 1];\n```\n\nThe second line of the function uses Java 8 streams to iterate through each element in the input ArrayList and increment the value of the corresponding index in the `frq` array. \n\n```java\nlst.stream().forEach(i -> frq[i.intValue()]++);\n```\n\nThe third line of the function initializes a variable called `ans` to -1. \n\n```java\nlong ans = -1;\n```\n\nThe fourth line of the function iterates through the `frq` array starting from index 1. If the value at the current index is greater than or equal to the index, the value of `ans` is set to the current index. \n\n```java\nfor (int i = 1; i < frq.length; i++) {\n    if (frq[i] >= i) {\n        ans = i;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`. \n\n```java\nreturn ans;\n```\n\nThe purpose of the function is to find the smallest non-negative integer that appears at least as many times in the input ArrayList as its value. For example, if the input ArrayList is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], the function should return 3 because 3 appears three times, which is greater than or equal to its value. The function should return -1 if there is no such integer in the input ArrayList. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong search(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_68_pluck", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> pluck(std::vector<long> arr) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_68_pluck.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = pluck;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)0, (long)3, (long)0, (long)4, (long)2}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3, (long)0, (long)5, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)3})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)4, (long)8, (long)4, (long)8}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)7, (long)6, (long)7, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)6, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)7, (long)9, (long)7, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an ArrayList containing the minimum even number in the input ArrayList and its index. If there are no even numbers in the input ArrayList, the function returns an empty ArrayList.\n\nThe function first checks if the input ArrayList is empty. If it is, it returns an empty ArrayList. If it is not, it filters the input ArrayList to get a List of even numbers. It does this by using the `stream()` method of the ArrayList class to create a stream of the elements in the ArrayList, and then using the `filter()` method of the Stream class to filter the stream to only include elements that satisfy a certain condition. In this case, the condition is that the element is even, which is checked using the modulo operator (`%`). The `collect()` method of the Stream class is then used to collect the filtered elements into a List.\n\nIf the resulting List of even numbers is empty, the function returns an empty ArrayList. If it is not empty, the function finds the minimum element in the List using the `Collections.min()` method, which returns the minimum element of a Collection. The function then creates a new ArrayList containing the minimum even number and its index in the input ArrayList, which is obtained using the `indexOf()` method of the ArrayList class.\n\nThe function is written in Java and uses several Java libraries, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that the function uses to implement its functionality.

This variable will be used to keep track of the index where the suffix of the input string starts.\n\nThe while loop that follows checks if the suffix of the input string starting from the index `beginningOfSuffix` is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the substring starting from `beginningOfSuffix` to the reverse of the same substring. If the substring is not a palindrome, the loop increments `beginningOfSuffix` and checks again. The loop continues until a palindrome is found.\n\nFinally, the function returns the input string concatenated with the reverse of the substring from the beginning of the input string up to the index `beginningOfSuffix`. This ensures that the resulting string is a palindrome.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string make_palindrome(std::string string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_83_starts_one_ends", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_83_starts_one_ends.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = starts_one_ends;\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((2)) == (18));\n    assert(candidate((3)) == (180));\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (1800));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (18000));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the number of integers that have `1` as the first digit and `n` digits in total. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to `1`. If it is, then the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it returns `18 * (long)Math.pow(10, n - 2)`. \n\nThe second line of the function is a conditional statement that checks if `n` is equal to `1`. If `n` is equal to `1`, then the function returns `1`. \n\nThe third line of the function is an expression that returns the number of integers that have `1` as the first digit and `n` digits in total. \n\nThe expression is `18 * (long)Math.pow(10, n - 2)`. \n\nThe `Math.pow` function is used to calculate `10` raised to the power of `n - 2`. The `long` cast is used to convert the result of `Math.pow` to a `long` integer. \n\nThe expression `18 * (long)Math.pow(10, n - 2)` multiplies the result of `Math.pow` by `18`. This is because there are `9` digits that can appear in the remaining `n - 1` digits of the number, and each of these digits can be followed by either `0` or one of the `9` digits. Therefore, there are `9 * 2 = 18` possible numbers that can be formed. \n\nFor example, if `n` is `3`, then there are `9 * 2 * 10 = 180` possible numbers that have `1` as the first digit and `3` digits in total. The `10` in the expression accounts for the fact that the second and third digits can be any of the `10` digits. \n\nTherefore, the function returns `18 * (long)Math.pow(10, n - 2)` for all values of `n` greater than `1`. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various Java libraries that are used in the function. \n\nThe `import java.util.*;` statement imports the `java.util` package, which contains various utility classes and interfaces. \n\nThe `import java.lang.reflect.*;` statement imports the `java.lang.reflect` package, which provides classes and interfaces for obtaining information about objects at runtime. \n\nThe `import org.javatuples.*;` statement imports the `org.javatuples` package, which provides classes for working with tuples. \n\nThe `import java.security.*;` statement imports the `java.security` package, which provides classes and interfaces for secure cryptography. \n\nThe `import java.math.*;` statement imports the `java.math` package, which provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and decimal numbers. \n\nThe `import java.io.*;` statement imports the `java.io` package, which provides classes for working with input and output streams. \n\nThe `import java.util.stream.*;` statement imports the `java.util.stream` package, which provides classes for processing streams of data. \n\nThe `class Problem` statement defines a new class called `Problem`. \n\nThe `public static long startsOneEnds(long n)` statement defines a new method called `startsOneEnds` that takes a `long` integer `n` as input and returns a `long` integer. \n\nThe `if (n == 1) return 1;` statement is\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_30_get_positive", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> get_positive(std::vector<long> l) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_30_get_positive.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = get_positive;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-2, (long)4, (long)5, (long)6}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)5, (long)6})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)3, (long)-5, (long)2, (long)3, (long)3, (long)9, (long)0, (long)123, (long)1, (long)-10}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)3, (long)2, (long)3, (long)3, (long)9, (long)123, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-2}))) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<long>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has a single method named `concatenate` that takes an `ArrayList` of `String` objects as its argument and returns a `String` object. The method uses the `String.join` method to concatenate all the strings in the `ArrayList` into a single string. The `String.join` method is a static method of the `String` class that takes two arguments: a delimiter and an iterable of `CharSequence` objects. In this case, the delimiter is an empty string, which means that the strings in the `ArrayList` will be concatenated without any separator. The method is declared as `public static`, which means that it can be called from anywhere in the program without creating an instance of the `Problem` class. \n\nThe code imports several packages at the beginning of the file, including `java.util`, `java.lang.reflect`, `org.javatuples`, `java.security`, `java.math`, and `java.io`. These packages provide various classes and methods that can be used in the program. \n\nThe `java.util` package provides classes for working with collections, such as `ArrayList`. The `java.lang.reflect` package provides classes and interfaces for obtaining information about classes and objects at runtime. The `org.javatuples` package provides classes for working with tuples, which are fixed-size collections of objects. The `java.security` package provides classes and interfaces for managing security, such as generating secure random numbers. The `java.math` package provides classes for working with arbitrary-precision integers and floating-point numbers. The `java.io` package provides classes for working with input and output, such as reading and writing files.\n\nThe `main` method is not included in the code, so it cannot be executed directly. However, the `Problem` class can be used as a utility class by calling its `concatenate` method from another class or method. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the `ArrayList` class with a C++ container that can hold strings, such as `std::vector<std::string>`. You would also need to replace the `String.join` method with a C++ function that can concatenate strings, such as `std::accumulate`. The rest of the code would need to be translated to C++ syntax, but the logic of the program would remain the same. \n\nHere is an example of how the `concatenate` method could be implemented in C++:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string concatenate(std::vector<std::string> strings) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_132_is_nested", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_nested(std::string string) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_132_is_nested.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_nested;\n    assert(candidate((\"[[]]\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"[]]]]]]][[[[[]\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[][]\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[]\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[[[[]]]]\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"[]]]]]]]]]]\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[][][[]]\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"[[]\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[]]\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[[]][[\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"[[][]]\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"[[[[[[[[\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"]]]]]]]]\")) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the string contains at least two nested square brackets. A nested square bracket is defined as a pair of square brackets where one pair is inside another pair. For example, the string `\"[[]]\"` contains one pair of nested square brackets, while the string `\"[]\"` does not.\n\nThe function first creates two empty lists called `openingBracketIndex` and `closingBracketIndex`. It then loops through each character in the input string and adds the index of each opening square bracket to `openingBracketIndex` and the index of each closing square bracket to `closingBracketIndex`. \n\nThe function then reverses the order of the elements in `closingBracketIndex`. It then initializes three variables: `cnt` to 0, `i` to 0, and `l` to the size of `closingBracketIndex`.\n\nThe function then loops through each index in `openingBracketIndex`. For each index, it checks if `i` is less than `l` and if the current index is less than the value at index `i` in `closingBracketIndex`. If both conditions are true, it increments `cnt` and increments `i`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `false` otherwise.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_nested(std::string string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_48_is_palindrome", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_palindrome(std::string text) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_48_is_palindrome.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_palindrome;\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"aba\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"aaaaa\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"zbcd\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"xywyx\")) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((\"xywyz\")) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((\"xywzx\")) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, \"racecar\" is a palindrome.\n\nThe function is called `isPalindrome` and takes a single parameter, a string called `text`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not.\n\nThe function first creates a new `StringBuilder` object called `sb`, which is initialized with the input string `text`. A `StringBuilder` is a mutable sequence of characters, which allows us to easily modify the string.\n\nThe function then checks whether the input string is equal to the reversed version of the string. To do this, it calls the `reverse` method on the `StringBuilder` object `sb`, which reverses the order of the characters in the string. It then calls the `toString` method on the `StringBuilder` object, which returns the reversed string as a regular string. Finally, it compares the reversed string to the original input string using the `equals` method, which returns `true` if the two strings are equal and `false` otherwise.\n\nOverall, the function is a simple and efficient way to check whether a string is a palindrome. It should be easy to translate this code to C++ by using the appropriate string manipulation functions and data types. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_palindrome(std::string text) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_108_count_nums", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_108_count_nums.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = count_nums;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-2, (long)0}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)2, (long)-2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (6));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)6, (long)9, (long)-6, (long)0, (long)1, (long)5}))) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)100, (long)98, (long)-7, (long)1, (long)-1}))) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)12, (long)23, (long)34, (long)-45, (long)-56, (long)0}))) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)1}))) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1}))) == (1));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The class has two methods: `countNums` and `digitsSum`. The `countNums` method takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns the count of elements in the ArrayList that have a positive digit sum. The `digitsSum` method takes a long as input and returns the sum of its digits.\n\nThe first line of the code imports several Java libraries: `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. These libraries provide various classes and methods that are used in the code.\n\nThe `Problem` class is defined on the second line of the code. It has a public static method called `countNums` that takes an ArrayList of Longs as input and returns a long. The method uses the `stream` method of the ArrayList to create a stream of Longs. It then uses the `map` method of the stream to apply the `digitsSum` method to each element of the stream. The `filter` method of the stream is then used to keep only the elements that have a positive digit sum. Finally, the `count` method of the stream is used to count the number of elements that remain after filtering.\n\nThe `digitsSum` method is defined on the ninth line of the code. It takes a long as input and returns a long. The method first checks if the input is negative. If it is, it multiplies it by -1 and sets a variable `neg` to -1. The method then converts the input to a string and splits it into an array of strings, where each string represents a digit of the input. The first element of the array is then converted to a long and multiplied by `neg`. Finally, the `mapToLong` method of the array is used to convert each string to a long and the `sum` method of the stream is used to sum the resulting longs.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_25_factorize", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> factorize(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_25_factorize.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = factorize;\n    assert(candidate((2)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((57)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)19})));\n    assert(candidate((3249)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)3, (long)19, (long)19})));\n    assert(candidate((185193)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)3, (long)3, (long)19, (long)19, (long)19})));\n    assert(candidate((20577)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)19, (long)19, (long)19})));\n    assert(candidate((18)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)3, (long)3})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of what the code does:\n\n1. `import java.util.*;` - Import the entire java.util package, which contains the ArrayList class used later in the code.\n2. `import java.lang.reflect.*;` - Import the entire java.lang.reflect package, which is not used in this code.\n3. `import org.javatuples.*;` - Import the entire org.javatuples package, which is not used in this code.\n4. `import java.security.*;` - Import the entire java.security package, which is not used in this code.\n5. `import java.math.*;` - Import the entire java.math package, which is not used in this code.\n6. `import java.io.*;` - Import the entire java.io package, which is not used in this code.\n7. `import java.util.stream.*;` - Import the entire java.util.stream package, which is not used in this code.\n8. `class Problem {` - Define a new class called Problem.\n9. `public static ArrayList<Long> factorize(long n) {` - Define a new public static method called factorize that takes a long integer n as input and returns an ArrayList of Long objects.\n10. `ArrayList<Long> fact = new ArrayList<>();` - Create a new ArrayList of Long objects called fact.\n11. `long i = 2;` - Initialize a long integer i to 2.\n12. `while (i <= n) {` - Start a while loop that continues as long as i is less than or equal to n.\n13. `if (n % i == 0) {` - Check if n is divisible by i with no remainder.\n14. `fact.add(i);` - If n is divisible by i, add i to the fact ArrayList.\n15. `n /= i;` - Divide n by i.\n16. `} else {` - If n is not divisible by i with no remainder, execute the following code block.\n17. `i++;` - Increment i by 1.\n18. `}` - End the if-else statement.\n19. `}` - End the while loop.\n20. `return fact;` - Return the fact ArrayList containing all the factors of n.\n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a factorization algorithm that iteratively divides a given number by all integers from 2 to the number itself, adding each factor to an ArrayList as it goes. The resulting ArrayList contains all the prime factors of the original number. The code could be easily rewritten in C++ using a vector instead of an ArrayList and a for loop instead of a while loop.

The function is called `largestPrimeFactor` and takes a single argument `n`, which is the number whose largest prime factor we want to find. The function returns a long integer, which is the largest prime factor of `n`.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `largest` to 1. It then loops through all numbers `j` from 2 to `n`. For each `j`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `j` and if `j` is a prime number. If both conditions are true, it updates the `largest` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `j`.\n\nThe function also defines another function called `isPrime`, which takes a single argument `k` and returns a boolean indicating whether `k` is a prime number. The function first checks if `k` is less than 2, in which case it returns `false`. Otherwise, it loops through all numbers `i` from 2 to `k-1` and checks if `k` is divisible by `i`. If `k` is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.\n\nThe code imports several libraries at the beginning, including `java.util.*`, `java.lang.reflect.*`, `org.javatuples.*`, `java.security.*`, `java.math.*`, and `java.io.*`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the code, so they could be removed.\n\nThe code also uses a lambda expression in the `isPrime` function to check if a number is prime. This lambda expression uses the `Stream` API to generate a stream of numbers from 2 to the square root of `k`, and then checks if any of these numbers divide `k` evenly. If any of them do, the lambda expression returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`. This lambda expression could be replaced with the original loop-based implementation if desired.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong largest_prime_factor(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_147_get_max_triples", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong get_max_triples(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_147_get_max_triples.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = get_max_triples;\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((6)) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (36));\n    assert(candidate((100)) == (53361));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function sorts each word in the input string alphabetically and returns the sorted words as a string. \n\nThe first line of the code imports several Java libraries. The `java.util.*` library provides utility classes for working with collections, while `java.lang.reflect.*` provides classes for working with reflection, which is a mechanism for inspecting and modifying the behavior of classes at runtime. The `org.javatuples.*` library provides classes for working with tuples, which are ordered lists of elements of different types. The `java.security.*` library provides classes for working with security, while `java.math.*` provides classes for working with mathematical operations. The `java.io.*` library provides classes for working with input and output streams, while `java.util.stream.*` provides classes for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.\n\nThe second line of the code defines a class called `Problem`. The class contains a single static method called `antiShuffle`, which takes a string as input and returns a string. The `public` keyword indicates that the method can be accessed from outside the class, while the `static` keyword indicates that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class.\n\nThe third line of the code defines the `antiShuffle` method. The method takes a string `s` as input and returns a string. The method splits the input string into an array of words using the `split` method of the `String` class. The `split` method takes a regular expression as input and returns an array of substrings that are separated by the regular expression. In this case, the regular expression is a space character, so the method splits the input string into an array of words.\n\nThe fourth line of the code uses the `Arrays.stream` method to create a stream of the words in the input string. The `Arrays.stream` method takes an array as input and returns a stream of the elements in the array.\n\nThe fifth line of the code uses the `map` method of the `Stream` class to apply a function to each element in the stream. The function takes a word `i` as input and returns a new string that contains the characters of the word sorted in alphabetical order. The `chars` method of the `String` class returns an `IntStream` of the characters in the string, while the `sorted` method of the `IntStream` class sorts the characters in ascending order. The `toArray` method of the `IntStream` class returns an array of integers that contains the sorted characters, while the `new String` constructor creates a new string from the sorted characters. The `0` and `i.length()` arguments of the `new String` constructor indicate the starting and ending indices of the characters to include in the new string.\n\nThe sixth line of the code uses the `collect` method of the `Stream` class to combine the sorted words into a single string. The `Collectors.joining` method takes a delimiter as input and returns a `Collector` that concatenates the elements in the stream with the delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space character, so the method concatenates the sorted words with spaces between them.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string anti_shuffle(std::string s) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_84_solve", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string solve(long N) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_84_solve.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = solve;\n    assert(candidate((1000)) == (\"1\"));\n    assert(candidate((150)) == (\"110\"));\n    assert(candidate((147)) == (\"1100\"));\n    assert(candidate((333)) == (\"1001\"));\n    assert(candidate((963)) == (\"10010\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `solve` and is defined in the `Problem` class.\n\nThe function first converts the long integer `N` to a string using the `Long.toString()` method. It then converts each character in the string to an integer by calling the `chars()` method on the string, which returns an `IntStream` of the characters in the string. The `map()` method is then called on the `IntStream` to subtract the character '0' from each character, effectively converting each character to its corresponding integer value. The `sum()` method is then called on the resulting `IntStream` to get the sum of all the integers.\n\nThe sum of the integers is then converted to a binary string using the `Long.toBinaryString()` method and returned as the result of the function. \n\nOverall, the function takes a long integer, converts it to a string, converts each character in the string to an integer, sums the integers, converts the sum to a binary string, and returns the binary string. \n\n\n### C++

The function returns an ArrayList of long integers called `ans`.\n\nThe function first gets the size of the grid and sets a variable called `val` to be the size of the grid plus one. It then loops through each element of the grid and checks if the element is equal to 1. If it is, it creates a new ArrayList called `temp` and adds the values of the elements to the left, right, top, and bottom of the current element to `temp`. It then sets `val` to be the minimum value in `temp`.\n\nAfter the loop, the function creates a new ArrayList called `ans` and loops through `k` times. If the current index is even, it adds 1 to `ans`. If the current index is odd, it adds `val` to `ans`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `ans`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> minPath(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long k) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_89_encrypt", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string encrypt(std::string s) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_89_encrypt.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = encrypt;\n    assert(candidate((\"hi\")) == (\"lm\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"asdfghjkl\")) == (\"ewhjklnop\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"gf\")) == (\"kj\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"et\")) == (\"ix\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"faewfawefaewg\")) == (\"jeiajeaijeiak\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"hellomyfriend\")) == (\"lippsqcjvmirh\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh\")) == (\"hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"a\")) == (\"e\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `makeAPile` and takes a single argument `n` of type `long`. \n\nThe function returns an ArrayList of long integers that is created using the `IntStream` class. The `IntStream` class is a stream of primitive integers. The `range` method of the `IntStream` class is used to create a stream of integers from 0 to `n - 1`. The `mapToObj` method is then called on the stream to map each integer `i` to the value `n + 2 * i`. The `collect` method is then called on the stream to collect the mapped values into an ArrayList of long integers. \n\nThe `makeAPile` function is declared as `public static`, which means it can be called from anywhere in the program without creating an instance of the `Problem` class. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the program are used to import various classes and packages that are used in the program. The `java.util.*` package is imported to use the `ArrayList` class. The `java.lang.reflect.*` package is imported to use the `Method` class. The `org.javatuples.*` package is imported to use the `Tuple` class. The `java.security.*` package is imported to use the `SecureRandom` class. The `java.math.*` package is imported to use the `BigInteger` class. The `java.io.*` package is imported to use the `IOException` class. The `java.util.stream.*` package is imported to use the `IntStream` class. \n\nThe `class` keyword is used to define a new class called `Problem`. The `Problem` class contains a single static method called `makeAPile`. \n\nThe `ArrayList` class is a class in the `java.util` package that is used to create a resizable array. The `ArrayList` class is parameterized with the type of object that it will store. In this case, the `ArrayList` is parameterized with the `Long` class, which is a wrapper class for the primitive `long` type. \n\nThe `mapToObj` method of the `IntStream` class is used to map each integer in the stream to a new object. In this case, the `mapToObj` method is used to map each integer `i` to the value `n + 2 * i`. The `collect` method of the `Stream` class is used to collect the mapped values into an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects. The `toCollection` method of the `Collectors` class is used to specify the type of collection that should be created. In this case, the `toCollection` method is used to create an `ArrayList` of `Long` objects. \n\nThe `range` method of the `IntStream` class is used to create a stream of integers from 0 to `n - 1`. The `range` method takes two arguments: the starting value of the range (inclusive) and the ending value of the range (exclusive). In this case, the starting value is 0 and the ending value is `n - 1`. \n\nThe `public` keyword is used to specify the access level of the `makeAPile` method. The `public` keyword means that the method can be accessed from anywhere in the program. The `static` keyword is used to specify that the method is a static method. A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to an instance of the class. \n\nThe `long` type is a primitive\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> make_a_pile(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_31_is_prime", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_31_is_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_prime;\n    assert(candidate((6)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((101)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((11)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((13441)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((61)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((11)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((17)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((85)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((77)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((255379)) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in C++.\n\n### Java version\n\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport org.javatuples.*;\nimport java.security.*;\nimport java.math.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.stream.*;\nclass Problem {\n    public static boolean isPrime(long n) {\n        if (n < 2) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        for (long k = 2; k < n; k++) {\n            if (n % k == 0) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that checks if a number is prime. \n\nThe function is called `isPrime` and it takes a single argument, `n`, which is a long integer. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is less than 2. If it is, then it returns false, since 2 is the smallest prime number. \n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 2, then the function enters a loop that iterates over all numbers from 2 to `n-1`. For each number `k` in this range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `k`. If it is, then `n` is not prime and the function returns false. \n\nIf the loop completes without finding a divisor of `n`, then `n` is prime and the function returns true. \n\nThe function is defined in a class called `Problem`. The class does not have any other methods or fields. \n\nThe code imports several packages at the beginning of the file. These packages are used to provide various utility functions and classes that are used in the implementation of the `isPrime` function. \n\nThe `java.util.*` package provides various utility classes and interfaces, such as `List`, `Set`, and `Map`. \n\nThe `java.lang.reflect.*` package provides classes and interfaces for working with reflection, which is a mechanism for inspecting and modifying the behavior of classes and objects at runtime. \n\nThe `org.javatuples.*` package provides classes for working with tuples, which are fixed-length sequences of elements of different types. \n\nThe `java.security.*` package provides classes and interfaces for working with security-related functionality, such as cryptography and secure random number generation. \n\nThe `java.math.*` package provides classes and interfaces for working with arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`. \n\nThe `java.io.*` package provides classes and interfaces for working with input and output, such as `InputStream` and `OutputStream`. \n\nThe `java.util.stream.*` package provides classes and interfaces for working with streams, which are sequences of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. \n\nThe `main` method is not defined in this code, so the code cannot be run directly. It is assumed that this code is part of a larger program that uses the `isPrime` function. \n\nTo translate this code to C++, you would need to replace the `long` type with `long long`, and replace the `java.util.*` package with the appropriate C++ standard library headers. You would also need to remove the `import` statements and replace the `class` keyword with `struct`. The `isPrime` function would remain the same. \n\nHere is the C++ equivalent of the code:\n\n```c++\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n"}]
