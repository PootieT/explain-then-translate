The function checks if it is possible to move one ball from one position in the array to another such that the array becomes sorted in ascending order. \n\nThe function starts by checking if the input array is empty. If it is, the function returns true since an empty array is already sorted. \n\nIf the input array is not empty, the function creates a sorted copy of the input array using the `dup` method and the `sort` function from the `std.algorithm` module. The `dup` method creates a copy of the input array, and the `sort` function sorts the copy in ascending order. \n\nThe function then creates a new array called `my_arr` by concatenating two slices of the input array. The first slice starts at the index of the minimum value in the input array and goes to the end of the array, while the second slice starts at index 0 and goes to the index of the minimum value in the array. This effectively rotates the array so that the minimum value is at the beginning. \n\nThe function then iterates over the length of the input array using a `foreach` loop. For each index `i`, it checks if the `i`th element of `my_arr` is equal to the `i`th element of `sorted_array`. If any element is not equal, the function returns false since the array cannot be sorted by moving one ball. \n\nIf all elements are equal, the function returns true since the array can be sorted by moving one ball. \n\nThe code uses several functions and modules from the D standard library, including `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide functions for working with arrays, converting between data types, formatting strings, performing mathematical operations, working with ranges, manipulating strings, and creating tuples. However, the code only uses a few functions from the `std.algorithm` and `std.array` modules. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively concise and easy to understand, although it does use some advanced features of the D language, such as ranges and slices. To rewrite the code in C++, one would need to use similar functions and libraries, such as `std::sort` and `std::vector`. However, the syntax and semantics of C++ are different from D, so the code would need to be adapted accordingly. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool move_one_ball(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

The function checks whether the input string is \"happy\" or not. A string is considered happy if it does not contain any consecutive repeated characters or any three consecutive characters that are the same.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the length of the input string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns false, since a string with less than 3 characters cannot be happy.\n\nNext, the function iterates over the input string using a foreach loop. The loop runs from the first character of the string to the second-to-last character of the string. For each character in the string, the function checks if any of the three consecutive characters starting from that character are the same. If any of the three consecutive characters are the same, the function returns false, since the string is not happy.\n\nIf the loop completes without returning false, the function returns true, indicating that the input string is happy.\n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library to implement the `is_happy` function. The `length` function is used to get the length of the input string. The `std.algorithm` module is used to provide the `foreach` loop construct. The `std.range` module is used to provide the `0 .. s.length - 2` range expression used in the loop. The `std.conv` module is used to convert the length of the string to an integer. The `std.array` module is not used in this function, but is imported for completeness. The `std.format` module is not used in this function, but is imported for completeness. The `std.typecons` module is used to provide the `Tuple` type used in the `std.algorithm` module. The `std.math` module is used to provide the `sqrt` function used in other parts of the D standard library. \n\nOverall, the `is_happy` function is a relatively simple implementation of a string processing algorithm that uses several features of the D programming language and its standard library. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_happy(std::string s) {\n"

The function returns a string that is the result of circularly shifting the digits of `x` by `shift` places to the left. \n\nThe function first converts the integer `x` to a string using the `to!string` function from the `std.conv` module. \n\nThe function then checks if the value of `shift` is greater than the length of the string `s`. If it is, the function returns the reversed string `s`. Otherwise, the function returns a concatenation of two substrings of `s`.

The function takes in an array of floating point numbers and a threshold value. The function returns true if there are two elements in the array that are closer than the threshold value, and false otherwise.\n\nThe function starts by importing several modules from the D standard library: `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide various utility functions and data types that the function will use.\n\nThe function then defines a `bool` variable called `has_close_elements` and initializes it to `false`. This variable will be used to keep track of whether or not there are two elements in the array that are closer than the threshold value.\n\nThe function then uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over each element in the array. The `foreach` loop is a shorthand way of iterating over a range of values. In this case, the range is the array of floating point numbers. The `foreach` loop assigns each element in the array to the variable `elem`, and the index of the element to the variable `i`.\n\nInside the `foreach` loop, the function uses another `foreach` loop to iterate over each element in the array again. This loop assigns each element to the variable `elem2`, and the index of the element to the variable `j`.\n\nThe function then checks if `i` is not equal to `j`. If `i` is equal to `j`, then the function is comparing the same element to itself, which is not useful. If `i` is not equal to `j`, then the function is comparing two different elements in the array.\n\nThe function then calculates the absolute value of the difference between `elem` and `elem2`, and assigns it to the variable `distance`. The `abs` function is a standard library function that returns the absolute value of a number.\n\nThe function then checks if `distance` is less than the threshold value. If `distance` is less than the threshold value, then the two elements are closer than the threshold value, and the function returns `true`.\n\nIf the function has iterated over all possible pairs of elements in the array and has not found any that are closer than the threshold value, then the function returns `false`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n"

The function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer `n` and returns the number of times the digit `7` appears in the string of numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13 up to `n`. \n\nThe function first creates an array `ns` of numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13 up to `n`. This is done using the `iota` function which generates a range of numbers from `0` to `n-1`. The `filter` function is then used to keep only the numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13. The `array` function is then used to convert the filtered range into an array.\n\nThe `map` function is then used to convert each number in the `ns` array to a string using the `to!string` function. The `join` function is then used to concatenate all the strings in the `ns` array into a single string `s`.\n\nFinally, the `count` function is used to count the number of times the character `'7'` appears in the string `s`. This count is then returned as the result of the function. \n\nThe code makes use of several D standard library functions:\n\n- `iota` generates a range of numbers\n- `filter` keeps only the elements of a range that satisfy a predicate\n- `array` converts a range to an array\n- `map` applies a function to each element of a range and returns a new range\n- `join` concatenates the elements of a range into a string\n- `count` counts the number of occurrences of a character in a string. \n\nThe code also makes use of several D language features:\n\n- `auto` is used to infer the type of a variable from its initializer\n- `!` is used to apply a template to a function or type\n- `=>` is used to define a lambda function\n- `.` is used to access member functions and properties of objects\n- `[]` is used to access elements of arrays and ranges\n- `()` is used to call functions and constructors\n- `;` is used to terminate statements\n- `{}` is used to define blocks of code. \n\nOverall, the code is concise and expressive, making use of the functional programming features of D to solve the problem in a few lines of code. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fizz_buzz(long n) {\n"

These modules provide a variety of functions and types that are used throughout the code.\n\nThe function then uses a nested loop structure to iterate over all possible triplets of integers in the array. The outermost loop iterates over the indices of the array, from 0 to the length of the array minus one. The second loop iterates over the indices of the array that come after the current index of the outer loop, from i+1 to the length of the array minus one. The third loop iterates over the indices of the array that come after the current index of the second loop, from j+1 to the length of the array minus one.\n\nWithin the innermost loop, the function checks whether the sum of the three integers at the current indices of the three loops is equal to zero. If it is, the function returns `true`, indicating that a triplet of integers that sum up to zero has been found.\n\nIf the function completes all iterations of the loops without finding a triplet of integers that sum up to zero, it returns `false`, indicating that no such triplet exists in the array.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool triples_sum_to_zero(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. \n\nThe function is named `smallest_change` and takes an array of long integers as its input. \n\nThe first line of the function initializes a variable `ans` to 0. \n\nThe `foreach` loop iterates over the first half of the array. For each element in the first half of the array, the loop checks if the element is equal to its corresponding element in the second half of the array. If the elements are not equal, the `ans` variable is incremented by 1. \n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`. \n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library, including `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. However, none of these functions are used in the `smallest_change` function itself. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and straightforward. It could be easily translated to C++ by replacing the `foreach` loop with a traditional `for` loop and using the appropriate syntax for array indexing. The standard library functions used in the code could be replaced with equivalent functions from the C++ standard library. \n\nHere is an example of how the `smallest_change` function could be implemented in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong smallest_change(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether or not it is possible to balance the weights in `q` on a seesaw with a maximum weight capacity of `w`. \n\nThe function first checks if the sum of the weights in `q` is greater than `w`. If it is, the function returns `false` because it is impossible to balance the weights on the seesaw. \n\nIf the sum of the weights in `q` is less than or equal to `w`, the function proceeds to check if the weights in `q` are symmetric. It does this by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. The function then iterates through the array, comparing the values at `q[i]` and `q[j]`. If the values are not equal, the function returns `false` because the weights are not symmetric. If the values are equal, the function increments `i` and decrements `j` and continues iterating through the array. \n\nIf the function reaches the end of the array without finding any non-symmetric weights, it returns `true` because the weights are symmetric and can be balanced on the seesaw. \n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library to accomplish its task. \n\n- `q.sum` calculates the sum of the elements in the `q` array. \n- `q.length` returns the length of the `q` array. \n- `std.algorithm` provides the `std.algorithm.reverse` function, which reverses the order of elements in an array. \n- `std.conv` provides the `std.conv.to` function, which converts between different types. \n- `std.typecons` provides the `std.typecons.Tuple` struct, which can be used to group multiple values together. \n- `std.range` provides the `std.range.iota` function, which generates a range of integers. \n- `std.math` provides various mathematical functions, such as `std.math.sqrt` for calculating square roots. \n\nOverall, the code is a relatively simple implementation of a common programming problem. It demonstrates the use of basic control structures, array manipulation, and standard library functions in D. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool will_it_fly(std::vector<long> q, long w) {\n"

The function checks if the input integer is a product of three prime numbers.\n\nThe code imports several modules from the standard D library: `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide various utilities for mathematical operations, algorithms, type conversions, arrays, ranges, formatting, and type construction.\n\nThe function `is_multiply_prime` defines an inner function called `is_prime` that takes a long integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value. The inner function checks if the input integer is a prime number by iterating over all integers from 2 to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any integer in this range, the function returns `false`. If `n` is not divisible by any integer in this range, the function returns `true`.\n\nThe outer function `is_multiply_prime` then iterates over all integers from 2 to 100 (inclusive) and checks if each integer is a prime number. If an integer is not a prime number, the function skips to the next integer. If an integer is a prime number, the function then iterates over all integers from 2 to 100 (inclusive) and checks if each integer is a prime number. If an integer is not a prime number, the function skips to the next integer. If an integer is a prime number, the function then iterates over all integers from 2 to 100 (inclusive) and checks if each integer is a prime number. If an integer is not a prime number, the function skips to the next integer. If an integer is a prime number, the function then checks if the product of the three integers is equal to the input integer `a`. If the product is equal to `a`, the function returns `true`. If the product is not equal to `a`, the function continues iterating over all possible combinations of three prime numbers.\n\nIf the function has iterated over all possible combinations of three prime numbers and has not found a product that is equal to the input integer `a`, the function returns `false`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_multiply_prime(long a) {\n"

The function takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is a power of `n`. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then the function returns true if `x` is also equal to 1. This is because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself, so the only way for `x` to be a power of 1 is if `x` is also equal to 1.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function initializes a variable `power` to 1. The function then enters a while loop that continues to multiply `power` by `n` until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is a power of `n`, then there exists some integer `k` such that `n^k = x`. The while loop calculates `n^k` by repeatedly multiplying `power` by `n`. If `x` is a power of `n`, then `power` will eventually become equal to `x`. If `x` is not a power of `n`, then `power` will eventually become greater than `x`.\n\nFinally, the function returns true if `power` is equal to `x`, indicating that `x` is a power of `n`, and false otherwise. \n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library, including `std.typecons`, `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, and `std.format`. However, none of these functions are actually used in the implementation of the `is_simple_power` function. \n\nThe `bool` keyword indicates that the function returns a boolean value. The `long` keyword indicates that the function takes two long integer arguments. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple and efficient implementation of a common mathematical problem. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_simple_power(long x, long n) {\n"

The function counts the number of even and odd palindromes between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and returns the counts as a tuple.\n\nThe function starts by defining an inner function called `is_palindrome` that takes a single argument `n` of type `long` and returns a `bool` indicating whether `n` is a palindrome. The function converts `n` to a string using the `to!string` function, then checks whether the string is equal to its reverse using the `dup` and `reverse` functions. The `dup` function creates a copy of the string, and the `reverse` function reverses the copy.\n\nThe function then initializes two `long` variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to 0.\n\nThe function then iterates over the range `1 .. n+1` using a `foreach` loop. For each value `i` in the range, the function checks whether `i` is odd and a palindrome. If so, it increments `odd_palindrome_count`. Otherwise, if `i` is even and a palindrome, it increments `even_palindrome_count`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the values of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`.\n\nThe code uses several standard library modules, including `std.range`, `std.typecons`, `std.algorithm`, `std.format`, `std.conv`, `std.math`, `std.array`, and `std.string`. These modules provide functions for working with ranges, tuples, algorithms, formatting, conversion, math, arrays, and strings, respectively. The code also uses the `Tuple` template from the `std.typecons` module to define the return type of the function. The `Tuple` template is used to create a tuple of two `long` values.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n"

The resulting filtered array is then converted to an `array` using the `array` method.\n\nThe resulting array is then sorted using the `sort` method and returned. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code are used to import various modules from the D standard library that are used in the implementation of the `common` function. These modules include `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. \n\nThe `long` data type is used to represent 64-bit integers in D. \n\nOverall, the `common` function is a simple implementation of an algorithm to find the common elements between two arrays.

The algorithm works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.

If it is, `s` is set to zero. \n\nThe sixth line updates `max_sum` to be the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`. \n\nThe seventh line checks if `max_sum` is zero. If it is, it sets `max_sum` to be the maximum element in the array `nums` after each element has been negated. \n\nThe eighth line initializes a variable `min_sum` to be the negative of `max_sum`. \n\nThe ninth line returns `min_sum`.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong minSubArraySum(std::vector<long> nums) {\n"

The function calculates the derivative of the input array, where the derivative is defined as the difference between consecutive elements of the array multiplied by their index. \n\nThe function starts by importing several modules from the D standard library: `std.typecons`, `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, and `std.format`. These modules provide various functions and data types that the function will use.\n\nThe function takes an array of long integers as input and returns an array of long integers. The function first declares an empty array called `result` that will store the derivative of the input array. \n\nThe function then enters a `for` loop that iterates over the input array, starting at the second element (index 1) and ending at the last element (index `xs.length - 1`). For each element in the input array, the function calculates the derivative by multiplying the element by its index and adding it to the `result` array using the `~=` operator. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` array containing the derivative of the input array. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, you would need to replace the `import` statements with `#include` statements for the appropriate C++ libraries, and replace the `long` data type with `long long` in C++. You would also need to replace the `~=` operator with the appropriate C++ operator for appending elements to an array. \n\nHere is an example of what the C++ code might look like:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> derivative(std::vector<long> xs) {\n"

If it does, it checks if the number represented by the string is greater than 0. If it is, it returns the ceiling of the number as a long integer using the `ceil` function from the `std.math` module. If the number is less than or equal to 0, it returns the floor of the number as a long integer using the `floor` function from the `std.math` module. \n\nIf the string does not end with \".5\", the code checks if the length of the string is greater than 0. If it is, it returns the rounded value of the number as a long integer using the `round` function from the `std.math` module. \n\nIf the string is empty, the function returns 0. \n\nThe code makes use of several D standard library modules, including `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate C++ standard library headers and replace the D-specific functions with their C++ equivalents. For example, you could use `std::stod` to convert the string to a double, `std::ceil` and `std::floor` to round up and down to the nearest integer, and `std::round` to round to the nearest integer. The `if` statements and `return` statements would remain the same. \n\nHere is an example C++ implementation of the same function:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong closest_integer(std::string value) {\n"

These variables will be used to store the sum and product of the array elements.\n\nThe `foreach` loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` array. For each element, it adds the element to `sum_value` and multiplies it with `prod_value`. \n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of `sum_value` and `prod_value`. \n\nThe code imports several modules from the D standard library including `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide various functions and data types that are used in the implementation of the `sum_product` function. \n\nThe `Tuple` type is a template type that is used to create a tuple of two long integers. The `tuple` function is used to create a new tuple with the values of `sum_value` and `prod_value`. \n\nOverall, the `sum_product` function is a simple implementation of a common programming problem that calculates the sum and product of an array of integers. The code is written in a concise and readable manner using D's built-in features and standard library modules. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> sum_product(std::vector<long> numbers) {\n"

The `iota` function generates a range of integers from 0 to `lst.length - 1`, and `map` applies a lambda function to each integer in the range. The lambda function maps each integer `i` to another range of integers generated by `iota(lst[i].length)`. This generates a range of all the possible coordinates in `lst`.\n\nThe `map` function is then used again to filter out all the coordinates that do not contain `x`. The lambda function checks if the value at the current coordinate is equal to `x` and returns a tuple of the current coordinate if it is. The `filter` function then removes all the tuples that have a value that is not equal to `x`.\n\nThe `joiner` function is then used to flatten the range of ranges of tuples into a single range of tuples. This is done so that the `sort` function can be applied to the entire range of tuples.\n\nThe `sort` function sorts the range of tuples by their first element in ascending order. If two tuples have the same first element, they are sorted by their second element in descending order. This sorts the tuples in the range by their row and column in `lst`.\n\nFinally, the sorted range of tuples is returned.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::tuple<long, long>> get_row(std::vector<std::vector<long>> lst, long x) {\n"

If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented by one, and the `max_depth` variable is updated to the maximum of the current `depth` and `max_depth` values. If the character is not an opening parenthesis, the `depth` variable is decremented by one.\n\nAfter iterating over all characters of the current element of the `paren_string` string, the function appends the `max_depth` value to the `res` array.\n\nAfter iterating over all elements of the `paren_string` string, the function returns the `res` array.\n\nOverall, the function is a relatively simple implementation of a common programming problem, and could be easily translated to other programming languages such as C++ with some minor modifications. \n\nHere is a possible C++ implementation of the same function:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> parse_nested_parens(std::string paren_string) {\n"

These modules provide various functions and types that are used in the rest of the code.\n\nThe second line defines a function called `even_odd_count` that takes a single argument, `num`, which is a `long` integer. The function returns a `Tuple` of two `long` integers.\n\nThe third and fourth lines declare two `long` variables, `even_count` and `odd_count`, and initialize them to 0.\n\nThe fifth line starts a `foreach` loop that iterates over each character in the string representation of the absolute value of `num`. The `to!string` function is used to convert `num` to a string, and `abs` is used to get the absolute value of `num` in case it is negative.\n\nThe sixth line checks if the current character is an even digit by using the `to!int` function to convert the character to an integer and then checking if it is divisible by 2 with the modulo operator `%`. If it is even, `even_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `odd_count` is incremented by 1.\n\nThe seventh line returns a `Tuple` containing `even_count` and `odd_count`. The `tuple` function is used to create the `Tuple` object. The `!` operator is used to specify the types of the elements in the `Tuple`. In this case, the types are `long` and `long`. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a common programming task. It uses several standard library functions to convert a number to a string, iterate over the characters in the string, and count the even and odd digits. The `Tuple` object is used to return two values from the function.

The function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all the numeric values in the string `s`.\n\nThe first line of the function splits the string `s` into an array of strings using the space character as a delimiter. The `split` function is a member of the `string` module in the standard library. The resulting array is then filtered using the `filter` function from the `algorithm` module to remove all non-numeric strings. The `filter` function takes a predicate function as an argument, which is applied to each element of the input range. The predicate function returns a boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the output range. In this case, the predicate function is a lambda function that checks whether the input string is numeric using the `isNumeric` property of the `string` type. The resulting array of numeric strings is then mapped to an array of long integers using the `map` function from the `array` module. The `map` function takes a function as an argument, which is applied to each element of the input range. The function returns a new value that is used to replace the original element in the output range. In this case, the function is a lambda function that converts each numeric string to a long integer using the `to` function from the `conv` module.\n\nThe second line of the function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all the elements in the resulting array of long integers. The `sum` function is a member of the `range` module in the standard library, which calculates the sum of all the elements in a range. The `array` property of the resulting range is used to convert the range to an array of long integers. The `long` keyword is used to specify the type of the output value of the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fruit_distribution(std::string s, long n) {\n"

The function returns the index of the first element in the array that is less than the previous element. If no such element is found, the function returns -1.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `ind` to -1. This variable will be used to store the index of the first element that is less than the previous element.\n\nThe function then iterates over the array using a foreach loop. The loop starts at index 1 and goes up to the length of the array. For each iteration, the loop checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, the index of the current element is stored in the `ind` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of the `ind` variable. If no element was found to be less than the previous element, the function returns -1. \n\nThe code makes use of several functions from the D standard library, including `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. However, none of these functions are actually used in the implementation of the `can_arrange` function. They are likely included for use in other parts of the program that are not shown in the code snippet. \n\nOverall, the `can_arrange` function is a simple implementation of a common programming problem, and could easily be rewritten in C++ or any other programming language. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong can_arrange(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

The function first defines an inner function `check` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string has balanced parentheses. The function `check` works by iterating over each character in the string and keeping track of a counter `val` that is incremented whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered and decremented whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered. If `val` ever becomes negative, the function returns `false` since this indicates that there is a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis. If `val` is zero at the end of the iteration, the function returns `true` since this indicates that all parentheses have been matched.\n\nThe function `match_parens` then concatenates the two input strings in two different orders and checks whether either of the resulting strings has balanced parentheses using the `check` function. If either string has balanced parentheses, the function returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, it returns \"No\". \n\nThe function makes use of several D standard library functions to simplify the implementation. The `~` operator is used to concatenate the two input strings. The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over the characters in a string. The `std.math` module is used to provide the `abs` function, which is not used in this implementation. The `std.algorithm` module is used to provide the `min` and `max` functions, which are not used in this implementation. The `std.conv` module is used to provide the `to` function, which is not used in this implementation. The `std.array` module is used to provide the `array` function, which is not used in this implementation. The `std.range` module is used to provide the `iota` function, which is not used in this implementation. The `std.format` module is used to provide the `format` function, which is not used in this implementation. The `std.typecons` module is used to provide the `Tuple` struct, which is not used in this implementation.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string match_parens(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

The function generates a sequence of even integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) and returns them as an array.\n\nThe function uses several functions from the D standard library:\n\n- `std.math.max` and `std.math.min` are used to find the maximum and minimum of two numbers.\n- `std.algorithm.iota` generates a range of integers between two numbers.\n- `std.range.filter` filters a range of values based on a predicate function.\n- `std.array.array` converts a range to an array.\n\nThe function first calculates the lower and upper bounds of the range of integers to generate. The lower bound is the maximum of 2 and the minimum of `a` and `b`. The upper bound is the minimum of 8 and the maximum of `a` and `b`. This ensures that the range of integers generated is at least 2 and no more than 8.\n\nThe `iota` function is then used to generate a range of integers between the lower and upper bounds. The `filter` function is used to filter out odd integers from the range, leaving only even integers. Finally, the `array` function is used to convert the filtered range to an array of long integers, which is then returned by the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> generate_integers(long a, long b) {\n"

The second argument to `to!string` is the base of the output string, which is 2 in this case, indicating that the output should be a binary string.\n\nThe concatenation of the three parts is done using the `~` operator, which is the string concatenation operator in D.\n\nThe function is defined in the `std.format` module, which is imported at the beginning of the code along with several other standard modules. \n\nThe `std.typecons` module provides a `Tuple` type, which is used to group multiple values into a single object. \n\nThe `std.math` module provides various mathematical functions.\n\nThe `std.algorithm` module provides a collection of algorithms for working with ranges.\n\nThe `std.array` module provides functions for working with arrays.\n\nThe `std.range` module provides functions for working with ranges.\n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a common programming task, and should be easy to translate to C++. The main difference between D and C++ in this case is the use of the `~` operator for string concatenation in D, whereas C++ uses the `+` operator. Additionally, the `to!string` function is not available in C++, but can be replaced with a standard library function or a custom implementation. \n\nHere is a possible C++ implementation of the same function:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string decimal_to_binary(long decimal) {\n"

The function then checks if the `balance` variable is less than zero. If the `balance` variable is less than zero, the function returns `true`, indicating that the sequence of numbers will go below zero. If the `balance` variable is not less than zero, the function continues iterating over the `operations` array.\n\nIf the function reaches the end of the `operations` array without finding a balance less than zero, the function returns `false`, indicating that the sequence of numbers will not go below zero.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool below_zero(std::vector<long> operations) {\n"

These modules provide various functions and types that are used in the program.\n\nThe `long greatest_common_divisor(long a, long b)` function takes two `long` integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. The remainder is stored in a temporary variable `temp`, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, while `b` is assigned the value of `temp`.

The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero, and returns `a` as the greatest common divisor. The program could be easily rewritten in C++ by importing the appropriate libraries and defining a similar function that implements the Euclidean algorithm. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong greatest_common_divisor(long a, long b) {\n"

If the reversed array is sorted in non-descending order, the function returns `true`.\n\nIf neither the original array nor the reversed array is sorted in non-descending order, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function uses several functions and modules from the D standard library:\n\n- `std.algorithm`: provides the `isSorted` function used to check if the array is sorted in non-descending order.\n- `std.array`: provides the `reverse` function used to reverse the array.\n- `std.conv`: provides the `to` function used to convert the boolean result of the `isSorted` function to a string.\n- `std.format`: provides the `format` function used to format the boolean result of the `isSorted` function as a string.\n- `std.math`: provides the `abs` function used to calculate the absolute value of a number.\n- `std.range`: provides the `reverse` function used to reverse the array.\n- `std.string`: provides the `join` function used to join the elements of an array into a string.\n- `std.typecons`: provides the `Tuple` struct used to return multiple values from the function. However, in this implementation, the `Tuple` struct is not used. \n\nThe function takes an array of long integers as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the array is monotonic. The function does not modify the input array. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool monotonic(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

If the character is not a vowel, it is appended to the `result` string using the `~=` operator. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` string. \n\nThe code makes use of several functions from the `std` module, including `algorithm`, `array`, `conv`, `format`, `math`, `range`, `string`, and `typecons`. These functions provide various utilities for working with strings, arrays, and other data types. However, they are not strictly necessary for this particular implementation of the `remove_vowels` function. \n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, one could define a function with the same signature as `remove_vowels` and use a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string. The `tolower` function from the `cctype` library could be used to convert each character to lowercase before checking if it is a vowel. The `+=` operator could be used to append non-vowel characters to the result string. Finally, the function would return the result string. \n\nHere is an example implementation in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string remove_vowels(std::string text) {\n"

If it is, it increments the `depth` variable by 1. If it is a closing bracket (`>`), it decrements the `depth` variable by 1. \n\nIf the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function immediately returns false. \n\nAfter iterating through all the characters in the input string, the function checks if the `depth` variable is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns true. Otherwise, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns false. \n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library to simplify the implementation. \n\n`std.algorithm` provides a collection of algorithms that can be used on ranges, such as `foreach`. \n\n`std.array` provides functions for working with arrays, but is not used in this code. \n\n`std.conv` provides functions for converting between types, but is not used in this code. \n\n`std.format` provides functions for formatting strings, but is not used in this code. \n\n`std.math` provides mathematical functions, but is not used in this code. \n\n`std.range` provides functions for working with ranges, such as `foreach`. \n\n`std.string` provides functions for working with strings, such as `length`. \n\n`std.typecons` provides various type constructors, but is not used in this code. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and easy to understand, even for someone who is not familiar with the D programming language. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"

If the character is present, the `total` variable is incremented by 1. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `total` variable. \n\nThe purpose of the function is to count the number of characters in the input string that are present in the `primes` string. The `primes` string is used as a lookup table to identify which characters are \"prime\" and should be counted. The function is named `hex_key` because it is likely intended to be used to generate a \"key\" for a hexadecimal string. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the `import` statements with appropriate `#include` statements for the C++ standard library. You would also need to replace the `long` type with the appropriate integer type in C++. The `foreach` loop can be replaced with a `for` loop that iterates over the characters in the input string using an index. The `canFind` method can be replaced with a loop that checks each character in the `primes` string for a match with the current character in the input string. The `return` statement can be left unchanged. \n\nHere is an example of how the `hex_key` function could be rewritten in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong hex_key(std::string num) {\n"

The function is called `is_bored` and it takes a string `S` as input.\n\nThe function first imports several modules from the D standard library: `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`.\n\nThe function then uses the `std.regex` module to split the input string `S` into sentences. This is done by calling the `split` function with two arguments: the input string `S` and a regular expression that matches the end of a sentence (i.e., a period, exclamation point, or question mark) followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The result of this operation is a range of strings, which is stored in the `sentences` variable.\n\nThe function then uses the `reduce` function from the `std.algorithm` module to count the number of sentences that start with the string \"I \". This is done by calling `reduce` with two arguments: a lambda function that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum, and a range of boolean values that are obtained by calling the `startsWith` function from the `std.string` module with the string \"I \" and each sentence in the `sentences` range. The `map` function from the `std.algorithm` module is used to apply the lambda function to each pair of boolean values, and the result is a single integer that represents the number of sentences that start with \"I \".\n\nFinally, the function returns this integer as its result.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong is_bored(std::string S) {\n"

The `std.conv` module provides functions for converting between different types, such as converting a string to an integer. The `std.format` module provides functions for formatting strings, such as the `format` function used in this function to create a string representation of the array. The `std.math` module provides mathematical functions, such as the `abs` function used in this function to compute the absolute value of a number. The `std.range` module provides functions for working with ranges of elements, such as the `opDollar` function used in this function to get the length of an array. The `std.string` module provides functions for working with strings, such as the `join` function used in this function to join the elements of an array into a single string. The `std.typecons` module provides various type constructors, such as the `Tuple` type used in this function to iterate over both the index and value of each element in the array. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem of finding pairs of elements in an array that sum to zero. It makes use of several useful functions from the D standard library to accomplish this task. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool pairs_sum_to_zero(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The function calculates the number of integers between 1 and 10^n that start with the digit 1 and end with any digit. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers that start with 1 and end with any digit by raising 10 to the power of `n-2` and multiplying the result by 18. This is because there are 9 possible digits that can be used to end the number, and each of those digits can be preceded by the digit 1. \n\nThe function uses several functions from the D standard library to perform its calculations. The `pow` function from the `std.math` module is used to raise 10 to the power of `n-2`. The `std.algorithm` module is used to perform the multiplication of the result of `pow` and 18. The `std.conv` module is used to convert the result of the calculation to a `long` value. The `std.array`, `std.range`, and `std.format` modules are not used in this function. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a mathematical formula that calculates the number of integers between 1 and 10^n that start with the digit 1 and end with any digit. The function is written in a clear and concise manner, and uses standard library functions to perform its calculations. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) {\n"

The function checks whether the string contains at least two nested square brackets. \n\nThe function starts by defining two empty arrays called `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` to store the indices of opening and closing square brackets in the input string. \n\nThe function then iterates through each character in the input string using a `foreach` loop. If the current character is an opening square bracket, its index is appended to the `opening_bracket_index` array. If the current character is a closing square bracket, its index is appended to the `closing_bracket_index` array.\n\nThe `closing_bracket_index` array is then reversed so that it can be used to check whether a closing bracket matches the most recent opening bracket. \n\nThe function then initializes a counter variable `cnt` to 0 and two index variables `i` and `l` to 0 and the length of the `closing_bracket_index` array, respectively. \n\nThe function then iterates through each index in the `opening_bracket_index` array using another `foreach` loop. For each index, the function checks whether there is a matching closing bracket at an index greater than the current value of `i` in the `closing_bracket_index` array. If there is, the function increments the `cnt` variable and increments the `i` variable to the next index in the `closing_bracket_index` array. \n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, indicating that there are at least two nested square brackets in the input string, and `false` otherwise. \n\nOverall, the function uses a simple algorithm to check whether a string contains nested square brackets, and could be easily translated to C++ by replacing the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_nested(std::string string) {\n"

It first checks if `n` is negative and sets a flag `neg` accordingly. It then converts `n` to a string, splits the string into an array of strings, maps each string to a long integer, and converts the resulting range to an array.

It uses the following functions from the D standard library: `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`.\n\nThe `largest_prime_factor` function takes a `long` integer `n` as input and returns a `long` integer. It first defines a nested function `is_prime` that takes a `long` integer `k` as input and returns a `bool`. This function checks if `k` is a prime number by iterating over all integers `i` between 2 and `k-1` and checking if `k` is divisible by `i`. If `k` is divisible by any integer between 2 and `k-1`, then `k` is not prime and the function returns `false`. Otherwise, the function returns `true`.\n\nThe `largest_prime_factor` function then initializes a `long` integer `largest` to 1. It then iterates over all integers `j` between 2 and `n+1`. For each `j`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `j` and if `j` is prime by calling the `is_prime` function. If `n` is divisible by `j` and `j` is prime, then it updates the `largest` variable to the maximum of its current value and `j`. After iterating over all `j`, the function returns the value of `largest`.\n\nOverall, the function works by checking all possible factors of `n` and keeping track of the largest prime factor found so far. It does this by iterating over all integers between 2 and `n+1`, checking if each integer is a factor of `n` and if it is prime, and updating the `largest` variable if a larger prime factor is found. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong largest_prime_factor(long n) {\n"

The `iota` function generates a range of integers from `1` to `n+1`. The `map` function is then called on each element of the range. The `map` function takes a lambda function that is applied to each element of the range. The lambda function takes in a single argument `i` of type `int` and returns `i*i - i + 1`. The `array` function is then called on the resulting range to convert it to an array. \n\nThe function then initializes a variable `ans` to `0`. It then loops through all possible combinations of three elements in the array `A`. This is done using three nested `foreach` loops. The first loop iterates over all elements of the array `A` from `0` to `n-1`. The second loop iterates over all elements of the array `A` from `i+1` to `n-1`. The third loop iterates over all elements of the array `A` from `j+1` to `n-1`. \n\nFor each combination of three elements, the function checks if the sum of the three elements is divisible by `3`. If it is, the variable `ans` is incremented by `1`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong get_max_triples(long n) {\n"

The function is called `make_a_pile` and takes a single argument `n` of type `long`. \n\nThe function returns an array of `long` integers that is created using the `iota` function from the `std.range` module. The `iota` function generates a range of integers from `0` to `n-1`. The `map` function is then called on each element of the range. The `map` function takes a lambda function that takes a single argument `i` of type `long` and returns the value `n + 2*i`. This means that the resulting array will contain `n` elements, where the `i`-th element is equal to `n + 2*i`.\n\nThe `array` function is then called on the resulting range to convert it to an array of `long` integers. The array is then returned by the function. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various modules from the standard library that are used in the implementation of the function. These modules include `std.range`, `std.typecons`, `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.format`, `std.math`, and `std.conv`. \n\nNote: The `iota` function generates a range of integers from `0` to `n-1`, not `0` to `n`. This means that the resulting array will contain `n` elements, not `n+1` elements. Additionally, the `make_a_pile` function could be simplified by removing the `array` function call and returning the range directly. This would make the function more memory-efficient, as it would not need to create an intermediate array. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> make_a_pile(long n) {\n"

If the input number is less than 2, the function returns false.\n\nThe next line initializes a for loop that runs from 2 to n-1. The loop variable `k` starts at 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches n-1. \n\nInside the loop, the code checks if n is divisible by k. If n is divisible by k, then n is not a prime number and the function returns false.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding a factor of n, then n is a prime number and the function returns true. \n\nThe code uses several standard D library functions to simplify the implementation. The `std.typecons` library is used to define the `Tuple` type, which is used to return multiple values from the function. The `std.math` library is used to define the `sqrt` function, which is used to optimize the loop by only checking factors up to the square root of n. The `std.algorithm` library is used to define the `any` function, which is used to check if any elements in a range satisfy a predicate. The `std.conv` library is used to convert between types. The `std.array` library is used to define the `array` function, which is used to create an array from a range. The `std.range` library is used to define the `iota` function, which is used to create a range of integers. The `std.format` library is used to define the `format` function, which is used to format output strings. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple and straightforward implementation of a prime number checker. It could be easily translated to C++ by replacing the D-specific library functions with equivalent C++ functions. For example, the `std.typecons` library could be replaced with a struct or class, the `std.math` library could be replaced with the `cmath` library, and so on. The loop could be implemented using a `for` loop or a `while` loop, and the `return` statements could be replaced with `break` statements. The resulting C++ code would be longer and less concise than the D code, but functionally equivalent.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n"
