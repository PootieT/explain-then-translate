It does this by iterating through each character in the string, and incrementing a counter for each opening bracket, and decrementing it for each closing bracket. If the counter ever goes negative, it means there was a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns false. If the counter is zero at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets were correctly balanced, so the function returns true. The program uses several standard D functions to make the code concise and readable. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_45_triangle_area", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long h) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_45_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = triangle_area;\n    assert(candidate((5), (3)) == (7.5f));\n    assert(candidate((2), (2)) == (2.0f));\n    assert(candidate((10), (8)) == (40.0f));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the array can be sorted by moving one element from the beginning of the array to the end of the array. If the array can be sorted in this way, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nThe function first checks if the array is empty, and if it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it creates a sorted copy of the array and a new array `my_arr` that is a concatenation of the original array starting from the minimum value and ending at the end of the array, and the original array starting from the beginning and ending at the minimum value. This effectively rotates the array so that the minimum value is at the beginning.\n\nThe function then iterates over the length of the array and checks if each element in `my_arr` is equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array. If any element is not equal, the function returns false.

If `n` has no odd digits, the function returns 0. The function first converts `n` to a string, then iterates over each character in the string. For each character, the function converts it to a long integer and checks if it is odd. If it is odd, the function multiplies it into the `product` variable and increments the `odd_count` variable. Finally, if `odd_count` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise it returns `product`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, you would need to replace `import` statements with `#include` statements, and replace D-specific functions like `to!string` and `to!long` with equivalent C++ functions. You would also need to declare the `digits` function with the appropriate return type and argument type. Here is an example C++ implementation of the `digits` function:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong digits(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_46_fib4", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib4(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_46_fib4.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = fib4;\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (28));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (104));\n    assert(candidate((12)) == (386));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The first 4 numbers of the sequence are stored in an array called `results`. If the input `n` is less than 4, the corresponding number is returned from the array. Otherwise, a loop is executed from 4 to `n+1`, where each iteration calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the last 4 numbers in the `results` array. The `results` array is then updated by appending the new number and removing the first number in the array to maintain the sliding window of size 4. Finally, the last number in the `results` array is returned as the result. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the necessary headers for the standard library functions used (`<cmath>`, `<algorithm>`, `<sstream>`, `<array>`, `<iterator>`, `<string>`), and replace the D-specific syntax with C++ equivalents. For example, the `auto` keyword would need to be replaced with the appropriate type, and the `foreach` loop would need to be replaced with a standard `for` loop. Additionally, the `results` array would need to be initialized with the first 4 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, and the `~=` operator would need to be replaced with `push_back()`.

It then iterates over the string using a foreach loop, checking each group of three adjacent characters to see if any of them are the same.

The function returns a string that is the result of circularly shifting the digits of `x` to the left by `shift` places. If `shift` is greater than the length of the string representation of `x`, the function returns the reverse of the string representation of `x`. The function first converts `x` to a string using the `to!string` function from the `std.conv` module. It then uses the `~` operator to concatenate two slices of the string representation of `x`, one that starts at the `shift`-th character from the end of the string and goes to the end of the string, and another that starts at the beginning of the string and goes to the `shift`-th character from the end of the string. If `shift` is greater than the length of the string representation of `x`, the function returns the reverse of the string representation of `x`, which is obtained by calling the `reverse` method on a copy of the string using the `dup` method. The program uses several modules from the D standard library, including `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`.

The function calculates the maximum number of items that can be placed in the 2D array, given that each item has a size of `capacity`. The function returns the maximum number of items that can be placed in the array.\n\nThe function calculates the maximum number of items that can be placed in the array by iterating over each row of the array and calculating the number of items that can be placed in that row. The number of items that can be placed in a row is calculated by dividing the sum of the row by the capacity and rounding up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function. The function then returns the sum of the number of items that can be placed in each row. \n\nThe program uses several functions from the `std` library, including `sum`, `ceil`, and `cast`. The `sum` function calculates the sum of the elements in a range, while the `ceil` function rounds a floating-point number up to the nearest integer. The `cast` function is used to convert the sum of the row to a floating-point number before it is divided by the capacity.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong max_fill(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long capacity) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_0_has_close_elements", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_0_has_close_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = has_close_elements;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.2f})), (0.3f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.2f})), (0.05f)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)5.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f})), (0.95f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)5.9f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f})), (0.8f)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.0f})), (0.1f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.1f, (float)2.2f, (float)3.1f, (float)4.1f, (float)5.1f})), (1.0f)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<float>({(float)1.1f, (float)2.2f, (float)3.1f, (float)4.1f, (float)5.1f})), (0.5f)) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns `y` if `n` is equal to 1 or if `n` is not prime. Otherwise, the function returns `x`.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `y`. If `n` is not equal to 1, the function loops through all integers from 2 to `n - 1` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `y`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `x`.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would define a function with the same name and arguments, and use a similar control flow structure to implement the logic of the `x_or_y` function. You would also need to include the appropriate C++ libraries for the functions used in the D program. For example, you might use the `std::sqrt` function from the `<cmath>` library to check if `n` is prime. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong x_or_y(long n, long x, long y) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_17_parse_music", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> parse_music(std::string music_string) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_17_parse_music.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = parse_music;\n    assert(candidate((\"\")) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((\"o o o o\")) == (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)4, (long)4, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((\".| .| .| .|\")) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)1, (long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((\"o| o| .| .| o o o o\")) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2, (long)1, (long)1, (long)4, (long)4, (long)4, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((\"o| .| o| .| o o| o o|\")) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)1, (long)2, (long)1, (long)4, (long)2, (long)4, (long)2})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `split` function is called on the input string with the argument \" \", which splits the string into an array of strings at each space. The `filter` function is called on the resulting array to remove any empty strings. The `map` function is called on the resulting array to map each string to its corresponding long integer using the `note_map` dictionary.

The specific syntax and function names may differ between D and C++, but the basic logic of the program should be the same.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong multiply(long a, long b) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_104_unique_digits", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> unique_digits(std::vector<long> x) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_104_unique_digits.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = unique_digits;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)15, (long)33, (long)1422, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)15, (long)33})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)152, (long)323, (long)1422, (long)10}))) == (std::vector<long>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)12345, (long)2033, (long)111, (long)151}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)111, (long)151})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)135, (long)103, (long)31}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)31, (long)135})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function iterates through the input string, keeping track of the current depth of parentheses and appending characters to a current string until it reaches the end of a group. It then adds the current string to the result array and resets the current string. The function then returns the result array. \n\nThe program imports several standard D libraries, including `std.string`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.typecons`, `std.algorithm`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.math`. These libraries provide various functions for working with strings, arrays, and other data types. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax and use the appropriate C++ libraries for working with strings and arrays.

The function first defines a string `vowels` that contains all the vowels in the English language. It then uses the `filter` function from the `std.algorithm` module to filter out all the characters in the input string that are vowels. The resulting filtered string is then counted using the `count` function from the same module. If the last character in the input string is 'y' or 'Y', the function adds 1 to the count of vowels. Finally, the function returns the total number of vowels in the input string. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate standard library headers and replace the D-specific functions and modules with their C++ equivalents. For example, you could use the `std::count` function from the `<algorithm>` header to count the number of vowels in the filtered string. You could also use the `std::string` class to represent the input string and the `std::string::find` function to check if the last character is 'y' or 'Y'.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The function even_odd_palindrome takes an integer n as input and returns a tuple with two integers: the number of even palindromes and the number of odd palindromes. \n\nThe function is_palindrome checks if a number is a palindrome by converting it to a string, duplicating it, and reversing the duplicate. If the original number and the reversed duplicate are equal, then the number is a palindrome. \n\nThe function then iterates over all numbers from 1 to n and checks if each number is a palindrome and even or odd. If it is odd and a palindrome, then the odd_palindrome_count is incremented. If it is even and a palindrome, then the even_palindrome_count is incremented. \n\nThe function returns a tuple with the even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific imports with their C++ equivalents, and replace the D-specific syntax with C++ syntax. For example, the tuple function would need to be replaced with a std::pair, and the foreach loop would need to be replaced with a for loop. The is_palindrome function would need to be rewritten to check if a number is a palindrome using C++ string manipulation functions. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_130_tri", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> tri(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_130_tri.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = tri;\n    assert(candidate((3)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8})));\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3})));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3, (long)15})));\n    assert(candidate((6)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3, (long)15, (long)4})));\n    assert(candidate((7)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3, (long)15, (long)4, (long)24})));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3, (long)15, (long)4, (long)24, (long)5})));\n    assert(candidate((9)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3, (long)15, (long)4, (long)24, (long)5, (long)35})));\n    assert(candidate((20)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8, (long)3, (long)15, (long)4, (long)24, (long)5, (long)35, (long)6, (long)48, (long)7, (long)63, (long)8, (long)80, (long)9, (long)99, (long)10, (long)120, (long)11})));\n    assert(candidate((0)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)3})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A cyclic pattern is a pattern that can be obtained by appending a string to itself. For example, `abcabc` is a cyclic pattern of `abc`. The function works by creating a new string `pat` that is the concatenation of `b` with itself. It then checks if any substring of `a` of length `l` is equal to any substring of `pat` of length `l`. If it finds a match, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible substrings of `a` and `pat`. The `foreach` loop is a shorthand for a `for` loop that iterates over a range of values. The `0 .. a.length - l + 1` range iterates over all possible starting positions of a substring of `a` of length `l`. The `0 .. l + 1` range iterates over all possible starting positions of a substring of `pat` of length `l`. The `if` statement checks if the two substrings are equal using the `==` operator. The `return` statement exits the function and returns a value. The `auto` keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer. The `~` operator is used to concatenate two strings. The `length` property is used to get the length of a string. The `..` operator is used to create a range of values. The `std` namespace contains various standard library functions and types. The `bool` keyword is used to specify the return type of the function. The `string` type represents a sequence of characters. The `foreach` loop can be replaced with a nested `for` loop. The `return` statement can be replaced with a variable that is set to `true` or `false` and then returned at the end of the function. The `auto` keyword can be replaced with the actual type of the variable. The `~` operator can be replaced with the `+` operator. The `length` property can be replaced with the `size` method. The `std` namespace can be omitted if the standard library is included with the `using namespace std;` directive. The `bool` keyword can be replaced with `bool` or `int`. The `string` type can be replaced with `std::string`. The `std::range` module can be used to create ranges. The `std::typecons` module can be used to create tuples. The `std::math` module can be used to perform mathematical operations. The `std::format` module can be used to format strings. The `std::conv` module can be used to convert between types. The `std::array` module can be used to create arrays. The `std::algorithm` module can be used to perform algorithms on ranges.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool cycpattern_check(std::string a, std::string b) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_114_minSubArraySum", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong minSubArraySum(std::vector<long> nums) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_114_minSubArraySum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = minSubArraySum;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)3, (long)4, (long)1, (long)2, (long)4}))) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-2, (long)-3}))) == (-6));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-2, (long)-3, (long)2, (long)-10}))) == (-14));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-9999999999999999}))) == (-9999999999999999));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)0, (long)10, (long)20, (long)1000000}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)-2, (long)-3, (long)10, (long)-5}))) == (-6));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)100, (long)-1, (long)-2, (long)-3, (long)10, (long)-5}))) == (-6));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)10, (long)11, (long)13, (long)8, (long)3, (long)4}))) == (3));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)100, (long)-33, (long)32, (long)-1, (long)0, (long)-2}))) == (-33));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)-10}))) == (-10));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)7}))) == (7));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)-1}))) == (-1));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It does this by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far. If the current sum becomes negative, it is reset to zero. If the maximum sum seen is zero, it means that all elements in the array are negative, so the minimum sum is simply the maximum negative element. Finally, the minimum sum is calculated as the negative of the maximum sum. \n\nThe program uses several functions from the D standard library, including std.algorithm, std.array, std.conv, std.format, std.math, std.range, std.string, and std.typecons. These functions provide a wide range of functionality, from basic array manipulation to advanced mathematical operations. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ code.

The lambda function compares two elements of the array and returns a boolean value indicating whether the first element should come before the second element in the sorted array. The lambda function uses the modulo operator to determine whether the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even or odd.

The Collatz sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the following rule: if the current number is even, divide it by 2, otherwise multiply it by 3 and add 1. The sequence terminates when it reaches 1. The function `get_odd_collatz` initializes an empty array `odd_collatz` if `n` is even, otherwise it initializes it with the value of `n`. It then generates the Collatz sequence by repeatedly applying the rule until it reaches 1, and adds any odd numbers in the sequence to `odd_collatz`. Finally, it sorts `odd_collatz` and returns it. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> get_odd_collatz(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_62_derivative", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> derivative(std::vector<long> xs) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_62_derivative.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = derivative;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)5}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)12, (long)20})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)6})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)1, (long)0, (long)4}))) == (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)2, (long)0, (long)16})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1}))) == (std::vector<long>()));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The output array is the derivative of the input array. The derivative of an array of numbers is an array of numbers where each element is the product of the index and the value of the corresponding element in the input array. \n\nFor example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the output array would be [0, 2, 6, 12]. The first element of the output array is always 0 because the derivative of the first element of the input array is always 0. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with C++-specific syntax. For example, you would need to replace the `import` statements with `#include` statements, and you would need to replace the `~=` operator with the `push_back` function. Other than that, the logic of the program should be the same. \n\nHere is an example of what the C++ version of this program might look like:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> derivative(std::vector<long> xs) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_63_fibfib", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fibfib(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_63_fibfib.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = fibfib;\n    assert(candidate((2)) == (1));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((8)) == (24));\n    assert(candidate((10)) == (81));\n    assert(candidate((12)) == (274));\n    assert(candidate((14)) == (927));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function uses the `maxElement` method of the array to find the maximum element. The `maxElement` method is provided by the `std.algorithm` module. \n\nThe `std.array` module provides functions for working with arrays.

If the string ends with \".5\", the function rounds up if the value is positive and rounds down if the value is negative. Otherwise, the function rounds to the nearest integer. The function uses several functions from the D standard library, including `std.conv.to`, `std.math.ceil`, `std.math.floor`, and `std.math.round`. To rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax and include the appropriate C++ standard library headers. You would also need to replace the D-specific function names with equivalent C++ function names. For example, `std.conv.to` could be replaced with `std::stod`, `std.math.ceil` could be replaced with `std::ceil`, and so on. Additionally, you would need to change the function signature to use C++ types instead of D types. For example, the function could be rewritten as `long closest_integer(std::string value)`. Overall, the program is a simple example of how to use D's standard library functions to perform common mathematical operations.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong closest_integer(std::string value) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_8_sum_product", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> sum_product(std::vector<long> numbers) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_8_sum_product.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = sum_product;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::make_tuple(0, 1)));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)1}))) == (std::make_tuple(3, 1)));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)100, (long)0}))) == (std::make_tuple(100, 0)));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)5, (long)7}))) == (std::make_tuple(15, 105)));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)10}))) == (std::make_tuple(10, 10)));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a long integer that is computed based on the values of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, the function returns `-1`. If `y` is even, the function returns `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the function returns `y - 1`. \n\nThe function is used to choose a number from a range of numbers. The range of numbers is defined by the values of `x` and `y`. The number to be chosen is the largest odd number in the range, or `-1` if there is no odd number in the range. If `x` is greater than `y`, there is no range of numbers, so the function returns `-1`. If `y` is even, the largest odd number in the range is `y - 1`, so the function returns `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, there is only one number in the range, so the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the largest odd number in the range is `y - 1`, so the function returns `y - 1`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with C++-specific syntax.

For example, you would need to replace `std.typecons` with `std::pair`, and replace `std.math` with `cmath`.

The function `words_in_sentence` first creates an empty array `new_lst` to store the words that will be kept. It then iterates over each word in `sentence` using the `foreach` loop and checks if the length of the word is either 1 or a prime number. If the length is not a prime number, the word is added to `new_lst`. Finally, the function returns a string that is the concatenation of all the words in `new_lst` separated by a space.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to use the appropriate C++ libraries for string manipulation and iteration.

The function splits the input string by spaces, filters out any empty strings, and then processes each non-empty string. For each string, the function computes the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The result is an array of maximum depths, one for each non-empty string in the input.\n\nThe function first initializes an empty long array called `res`. It then iterates over each non-empty string in the input using a `foreach` loop. For each string, it initializes two long variables, `depth` and `max_depth`, to zero. It then iterates over each character in the string using another `foreach` loop. If the character is an opening parenthesis, `depth` is incremented and `max_depth` is updated to the maximum of `depth` and `max_depth`. If the character is a closing parenthesis, `depth` is decremented. After processing all characters in the string, the maximum depth of nested parentheses is stored in the `res` array using the `~=` operator.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` array. \n\nThe program imports several modules from the D standard library: `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide various utility functions and data types used in the implementation of `parse_nested_parens`. \n\nTo translate this program to C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, you would need to replace `long[]` with `std::vector<long>` and `foreach` loops with `for` loops. You would also need to replace the D-specific string functions with equivalent C++ functions. The specific changes required would depend on the details of the C++ implementation. \n\nHere is a possible C++ implementation of `parse_nested_parens`:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> parse_nested_parens(std::string paren_string) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_155_even_odd_count", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_count(long num) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_155_even_odd_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = even_odd_count;\n    assert(candidate((7)) == (std::make_tuple(0, 1)));\n    assert(candidate((-78)) == (std::make_tuple(1, 1)));\n    assert(candidate((3452)) == (std::make_tuple(2, 2)));\n    assert(candidate((346211)) == (std::make_tuple(3, 3)));\n    assert(candidate((-345821)) == (std::make_tuple(3, 3)));\n    assert(candidate((-2)) == (std::make_tuple(1, 0)));\n    assert(candidate((-45347)) == (std::make_tuple(2, 3)));\n    assert(candidate((0)) == (std::make_tuple(1, 0)));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `map` function is then called on the resulting array to convert all remaining strings to long integers. The `array` function is then called on the resulting range to create an array of long integers. Finally, the `sum` function is called on the array to calculate the sum of all the long integers in the array. The result of `n` minus the sum of the array is then returned. \n\nThe purpose of this program is to calculate the amount of fruit that is left over after distributing it evenly among `n` people. The input string `s` contains the number of fruits of each type that are available. The program calculates the total number of fruits available by summing the values in the input string, and then subtracts this from `n` to determine the amount of fruit that is left over. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fruit_distribution(std::string s, long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_11_string_xor", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string string_xor(std::string a, std::string b) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_11_string_xor.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = string_xor;\n    assert(candidate((\"111000\"), (\"101010\")) == (\"010010\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"1\"), (\"1\")) == (\"0\"));\n    assert(candidate((\"0101\"), (\"0000\")) == (\"0101\"));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If no such element exists, it returns -1.\n\nThe function iterates over the array using a foreach loop, comparing each element to the previous one. If an element is smaller than the previous one, the index of that element is returned.\n\nThe `foreach` loop uses the `..` range operator to iterate over the indices of the array, starting from 1 and ending at the length of the array. This is because we need to compare each element to the previous one, so we start at index 1.\n\nThe `if` statement checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one. If it is, the index of the current element is stored in the `ind` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ind`.

It then creates a new range that only includes every other element of the slice (`stride(2)`). It filters this range to only include elements that are even (`filter!(x => x % 2 == 0)`), and then calculates the sum of the resulting range (`sum`). The final sum is returned by the function. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, the `std.algorithm` module would need to be replaced with the equivalent C++ standard library functions, and the `std.conv` module would need to be replaced with appropriate type conversions. The `std.range` module would need to be replaced with equivalent range-based for loops or iterators.

The `generate_integers` function takes two long integers `a` and `b` as input and returns an array of long integers. The function first calculates the lower and upper bounds of the range of integers to generate. The lower bound is the maximum of 2 and the minimum of `a` and `b`. The upper bound is the minimum of 8 and the maximum of `a` and `b`. The function then generates a range of integers from `lower` to `upper+1` using the `iota` function.

The `!(i => i % 2 == 1)` syntax is a lambda function that returns true if the input is odd. The `count` function returns the number of elements in the array that satisfy this predicate. The same is done for the second array, but with the predicate `!(i => i % 2 == 0)` which returns true if the input is even.\n\nThe `exchange` function takes two arrays as input and returns a string \"YES\" or \"NO\" depending on the result of the comparison. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific functions with their C++ equivalents.

The function checks whether the input integers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. If the input integers satisfy this condition, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate headers and define the function `right_angle_triangle` in C++ syntax.

The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD. \n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal. At this point, the GCD is the common value. If one number is zero, the other number is the GCD.\n\nThe function uses a while loop to repeatedly calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and update the values of `a` and `b` until `b` is zero. At this point, `a` contains the GCD and is returned.\n\nThe program imports several modules from the standard library, including `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide various utility functions and data types that are used in the implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function. \n\nTo translate this program to C++, you would need to include the appropriate header files for the standard library functions and data types used in the program. You would also need to translate the syntax of the program from D to C++. The `while` loop in the `greatest_common_divisor` function would need to be rewritten using C++ syntax, and the `auto` keyword used in the program would need to be replaced with the appropriate data type. Additionally, the `long` data type used in the function signature would need to be replaced with the appropriate C++ data type. \n\nHere is an example of what the translated C++ code might look like:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong greatest_common_divisor(long a, long b) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_106_f", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> f(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_106_f.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = f;\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)6, (long)24, (long)15})));\n    assert(candidate((7)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)6, (long)24, (long)15, (long)720, (long)28})));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1})));\n    assert(candidate((3)) == (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)6})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the list is not sorted in non-descending order, the function checks if the list is sorted in non-ascending order by reversing the list and checking if it is sorted in non-descending order. If either of these conditions are true, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. \n\nThe program uses several functions from the standard library of the D programming language, including `isSorted`, `reverse`, and `isSortedBy`. The `isSorted` method checks if a range is sorted in non-descending order, while the `reverse` method returns a range with the elements of the original range in reverse order. The `isSortedBy` method checks if a range is sorted according to a given comparison function. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to use the appropriate functions from the C++ standard library to perform the same operations. For example, you could use the `std::is_sorted` function to check if a range is sorted in non-descending order, and the `std::reverse` function to reverse a range. You would also need to write a comparison function to check if a range is sorted in non-ascending order. \n\nHere is an example implementation of the `monotonic` function in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool monotonic(std::vector<long> l) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_105_by_length", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> by_length(std::vector<long> arr) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_105_by_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = by_length;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)1, (long)1, (long)4, (long)5, (long)8, (long)2, (long)3}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Eight\", (std::string)\"Five\", (std::string)\"Four\", (std::string)\"Three\", (std::string)\"Two\", (std::string)\"Two\", (std::string)\"One\", (std::string)\"One\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>())) == (std::vector<std::string>()));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)-1, (long)55}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"One\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)-1, (long)3, (long)2}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Three\", (std::string)\"Two\", (std::string)\"One\"})));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)9, (long)4, (long)8}))) == (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Nine\", (std::string)\"Eight\", (std::string)\"Four\"})));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function first creates a dictionary of strings that maps integers 1-9 to their corresponding English word. It then sorts the input array in descending order and iterates over it, appending the corresponding English word to the output array for each integer in the input array that is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). The output array is then returned. \n\nThe purpose of this program is to convert an array of integers into an array of their corresponding English words, but only for integers between 1 and 9. The resulting array is sorted in descending order. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, you would need to replace `auto` with the appropriate type, and replace `foreach` with a `for` loop.

The function iterates over each character in the input string, checking if it is a vowel (either upper or lower case), and if not, adding it to the result string. The `canFind` function is used to check if a character is a vowel, and the `toLower` function is used to convert the character to lower case before checking. The `~=` operator is used to concatenate the characters onto the result string. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to define a function with the same signature as `remove_vowels`, and then implement the same logic using C++ syntax and functions.

The `iscube` function takes a long integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is a perfect cube. The function first takes the absolute value of the input, then computes the cube root of the absolute value using the `pow` function from `std.math`. The `round` function is then used to round the result to the nearest integer, which is then cubed using the `^^` operator. If the result of this operation is equal to the original absolute value of the input, the function returns `true`, indicating that the input is a perfect cube. Otherwise, the function returns `false`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate headers for the functions used in the `iscube` function, and then write a similar function that performs the same operations.

The brackets are `<` and `>`. If the brackets are balanced, then the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. The function iterates through each character in the string and keeps track of the depth of the brackets. If the depth goes negative, then the brackets are not balanced and the function returns `false`. If the depth is zero at the end of the string, then the brackets are balanced and the function returns `true`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the `foreach` loop with a `for` loop and use the `std::string` class instead of the D `string` type. You would also need to replace the `if` statement that checks for `<` with a call to the `std::count` function.

Finally, the `reduce` function is used to sum the boolean values in the list, returning the total number of sentences that start with `\"I \"`. This value is returned as a long integer.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong is_bored(std::string S) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_18_how_many_times", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong how_many_times(std::string string, std::string substring) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_18_how_many_times.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = how_many_times;\n    assert(candidate((\"\"), (\"x\")) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((\"xyxyxyx\"), (\"x\")) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((\"cacacacac\"), (\"cac\")) == (4));\n    assert(candidate((\"john doe\"), (\"john\")) == (1));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function uses a loop to iterate over all possible substrings of the first string that are the same length as the second string, and checks if each substring is equal to the second string. If a match is found, the count of matches is incremented. The function then returns the final count of matches. The program imports several standard library modules to provide various utility functions, such as string manipulation and formatting. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate header files for the standard library functions used, and translate the syntax of the D code into C++ syntax. For example, the `foreach` loop in D could be translated to a `for` loop in C++. The `long` data type in D could be translated to `long long` in C++ to ensure sufficient range for the count of matches. The resulting C++ code might look something like this:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong how_many_times(std::string string, std::string substring) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_121_solution", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong solution(std::vector<long> lst) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_121_solution.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = solution;\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)8, (long)7, (long)1}))) == (12));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)3, (long)3, (long)3, (long)3}))) == (9));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)30, (long)13, (long)24, (long)321}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)9}))) == (5));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)4, (long)8}))) == (0));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)30, (long)13, (long)23, (long)32}))) == (23));\n    assert(candidate((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)13, (long)2, (long)9}))) == (3));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function first finds the indices of all opening and closing square brackets in the string using two arrays `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`. It then iterates over the opening brackets and counts the number of times an opening bracket is found before the corresponding closing bracket. If this count is at least 2, the function returns true, indicating that the string contains at least two nested square brackets. Otherwise, it returns false. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. The function uses the `dup` method to create a copy of the string, then the `reverse` method to reverse the copy. The original string is then compared to the reversed copy using the `==` operator. If they are equal, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

It first checks if the input is negative, and if so, it multiplies it by -1 and sets a flag `neg` to -1. It then converts the input to a string, splits the string into an array of strings (one for each digit), maps each string to a `long` integer, and returns the sum of the resulting array. The first digit is multiplied by `neg` to account for the negative sign.\n\nThe `count_nums` function maps each element of the input array to its digit sum using `digits_sum`, filters out the elements that have a digit sum of 0 or less, and returns the count of the remaining elements. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, you would need to replace `import` statements with `#include` statements, and replace D-specific functions like `to!string` and `array` with equivalent C++ functions.

The function works by iterating over all integers `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`, checking if `i` is a factor of `n`, and if so, adding it to the array and dividing `n` by `i`. If `i` is not a factor of `n`, it is incremented by 1. If `n` is greater than 1 after the loop, it means that `n` itself is a prime factor and is added to the array. The function then returns the array of prime factors. \n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate headers and replace the D-specific syntax with C++ equivalents.

The array is created by calling the `iota` function with arguments `0` and `n`. This creates a range of integers from `0` to `n-1`. The `map` function is then called on this range, which applies a lambda function to each element of the range. The lambda function takes a single argument `i` of type `long` and returns `n + 2*i`. This creates a new range of integers that are `n` greater than the original range, with an additional offset of `2*i` for each element. Finally, the `array` function is called on this range to convert it to an array, which is then returned by the `make_a_pile` function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> make_a_pile(long n) {\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_31_is_prime", "language": "cpp", "prompt": "#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_31_is_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\nint main() {\n    auto candidate = is_prime;\n    assert(candidate((6)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((101)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((11)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((13441)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((61)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((4)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((1)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((5)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((11)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((17)) == (true));\n    assert(candidate((85)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((77)) == (false));\n    assert(candidate((255379)) == (false));\n}\n", "stop_tokens": ["\n}"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the input is less than 2 and returns false if it is. It then loops through all integers from 2 to n-1 and checks if n is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function returns false. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns true. \n\nThe program imports several modules from the D standard library, including `std.typecons`, `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, and `std.format`. These modules provide various utilities for working with types, math functions, algorithms, conversions, arrays, ranges, and formatting. \n\nTo translate this program to C++, you would need to define a function `is_prime` that takes a long integer and returns a boolean. You would then need to implement the same logic as in the D version, checking if the input is less than 2, looping through all integers from 2 to n-1, and checking if n is divisible by any of them. You would also need to include any necessary headers for the C++ standard library functions used in the implementation. \n\nHere's an example implementation of `is_prime` in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_prime(long n) {\n"}]
