The function returns true if the brackets are correctly bracketed and false otherwise.\n\nThe function takes a string of brackets as input.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `depth` to 0. The variable `depth` is used to keep track of the depth of the brackets. The depth of the brackets is the number of open brackets minus the number of closed brackets encountered so far.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the input string using a `foreach` loop. For each character, the function checks if the character is an open bracket. If the character is an open bracket, the function increments the `depth` variable by 1. If the character is a closed bracket, the function decrements the `depth` variable by 1. If the `depth` variable becomes negative at any point during the iteration, the function returns false, indicating that the brackets are not correctly bracketed.\n\nAfter the iteration is complete, the function checks if the `depth` variable is equal to 0. If the `depth` variable is equal to 0, the function returns true, indicating that the brackets are correctly bracketed. Otherwise, the function returns false.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {\n"

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this implementation, the sequence is modified to include the sum of the four preceding numbers.\n\nThe first line imports several modules from the D standard library. The `std.math` module provides mathematical functions, `std.algorithm` provides algorithms for working with ranges, `std.conv` provides functions for converting between types, `std.array` provides functions for working with arrays, `std.range` provides functions for working with ranges, `std.format` provides functions for formatting strings, and `std.typecons` provides type constructors.\n\nThe `fib4` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the modified Fibonacci sequence. The function initializes an array `results` with the first four numbers in the sequence. If `n` is less than 4, the function returns the `n`th number in the sequence from the `results` array.\n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the function enters a loop that calculates the remaining numbers in the sequence. The loop iterates over the range `4..n+1`, which generates the numbers from 4 to `n` inclusive. For each number `i` in the range, the function calculates the sum of the four preceding numbers in the sequence and appends the result to the `results` array. The `results` array is then truncated to remove the first element, which corresponds to the oldest number in the sequence.\n\nFinally, the function returns the last element in the `results` array, which corresponds to the `n`th number in the sequence.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib4(long n) {\n"

The function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns false, since a string of length less than 3 cannot contain three consecutive identical characters.\n\nIf the length of the string is greater than or equal to 3, the function iterates over the string using a foreach loop. The loop iterates over the indices of the string from 0 to the length of the string minus 2.

The function `circular_shift` takes two arguments, `x` and `shift`, and returns a string representing the circular shift of `x` by `shift` digits.\n\nThe function first converts the input number `x` to a string using the `to!string` function from the `std.conv` module. It then checks if the `shift` value is greater than the length of the string `s`. If it is, it returns the reversed string `s.dup.reverse`. Otherwise, it returns the concatenation of two substrings of `s`, one starting from the `s.length - shift` index and ending at the end of the string (`$`), and the other starting from the beginning of the string and ending at the `s.length - shift` index.\n\nThe `~` operator is used to concatenate the two substrings. The `..` operator is used to create a range of indices for the substring. The `$` symbol is used to represent the end of the string.\n\nThe code uses several modules from the D standard library, including `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`.

The function returns `x` if `n` is a prime number, otherwise it returns `y`. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then it returns `y`. This is because 1 is not a prime number and the function should return `y` for non-prime numbers.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function loops through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` using a `foreach` loop. For each number, it checks if `n` is divisible by that number using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, then it is not a prime number and the function returns `y`.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding a divisor for `n`, then `n` is a prime number and the function returns `x`.\n\nThe `long` keyword before the function name and arguments specifies that they are of type `long`. The `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various modules from the D standard library that are used in the function. \n\nThe `std.algorithm` module provides various algorithms for working with ranges of values. The `std.array` module provides functions for working with arrays. The `std.conv` module provides functions for converting between different types. The `std.format` module provides functions for formatting strings. The `std.math` module provides various mathematical functions. The `std.range` module provides functions for working with ranges of values. The `std.string` module provides functions for working with strings. The `std.typecons` module provides various type constructors. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a prime number checker. It could be rewritten in C++ using similar logic and syntax. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong x_or_y(long n, long x, long y) {\n"

The function is defined on line 6 and returns an array of long integers.\n\nThe function first creates a dictionary `note_map` on line 7 that maps note symbols to their corresponding integer values. The dictionary is defined using the D programming language's associative array syntax. The keys of the dictionary are strings that represent the note symbols, and the values are the corresponding integer values.\n\nThe function then splits the input string `music_string` into an array of strings using the `split` method on line 8. The `split` method splits the string into an array of substrings using the specified delimiter, which in this case is a space character `\" \"`. The resulting array of substrings is then filtered using the `filter` method on line 8. The `filter` method removes any empty strings from the array. The `filter` method takes a lambda function as an argument, which is defined using the D programming language's lambda syntax. The lambda function takes a string `x` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not `x` is empty.\n\nThe resulting array of non-empty substrings is then mapped to their corresponding integer values using the `map` method on line 8. The `map` method takes a lambda function as an argument, which is defined using the D programming language's lambda syntax. The lambda function takes a string `x` as input and returns the corresponding integer value from the `note_map` dictionary. The resulting array of integer values is then converted to an array of long integers using the `array` method on line 8.\n\nThe resulting array of long integers is then returned by the function on line 9.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> parse_music(std::string music_string) {\n"

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers. For example, the first ten numbers in the sequence are:\n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\n\nThe function fib() takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function uses recursion to calculate the value of the nth number by adding the values of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe function first checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. If n is 0, the function returns 0. If n is 1, the function returns 1. If n is neither 0 nor 1, the function recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and adds the results of these two recursive calls to get the value of the nth number in the sequence.\n\nThe code uses several standard D library functions, including std.array, std.format, std.algorithm, std.conv, std.typecons, std.range, and std.math. These libraries provide functions for working with arrays, formatting strings, performing common algorithms, converting between data types, working with tuples, working with ranges, and performing mathematical operations, respectively.\n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you could use a similar recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. Here is an example implementation in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong fib(long n) {\n"

If it is, the function returns `true` indicating that there are three elements in the array that sum up to zero. If no such combination is found, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library to simplify the implementation. The `std.algorithm` module provides a `foreach` loop construct that can be used to iterate over the elements of an array. The `std.array` module provides functions for working with arrays, such as `length` to get the length of an array. The `std.conv` module provides functions for converting between different types, such as `to!string` to convert a number to a string. The `std.format` module provides functions for formatting strings, such as `format` to create a formatted string. The `std.math` module provides mathematical functions, such as `abs` to calculate the absolute value of a number. The `std.range` module provides functions for working with ranges, such as `until` to create a range of numbers. The `std.string` module provides functions for working with strings, such as `join` to join an array of strings into a single string. The `std.typecons` module provides type constructors, such as `Tuple` to create a tuple of values.\n\nOverall, the code is a straightforward implementation of the problem using nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three elements in the array. The use of standard library functions helps to simplify the implementation and make it more readable. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool triples_sum_to_zero(std::vector<long> l) {\n"

The function takes in a long integer `a` and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the input integer is a product of three prime numbers between 2 and 100. \n\nThe code imports several modules from the D standard library. The `std.math` module provides mathematical functions such as `sqrt` and `pow`. The `std.algorithm` module provides algorithms such as `sort` and `minmax`. The `std.conv` module provides functions for converting between types. The `std.array` module provides functions for working with arrays. The `std.range` module provides functions for working with ranges. The `std.format` module provides functions for formatting strings. The `std.typecons` module provides various type constructors.\n\nThe function `is_multiply_prime` is defined within the code. The function `is_prime` is defined within `is_multiply_prime`. `is_prime` takes in a long integer `n` and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the input integer is a prime number. The function iterates through all integers between 2 and `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of them, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, the function returns `true`.\n\nThe function `is_multiply_prime` iterates through all possible combinations of three prime numbers between 2 and 100. For each combination, the function checks if the product of the three numbers is equal to the input integer `a`. If the product is equal to `a`, the function returns `true`. If no combination of three prime numbers results in a product equal to `a`, the function returns `false`.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_multiply_prime(long a) {\n"

The function checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`, meaning that `x` can be written as `n^k` for some integer `k`.\n\nThe function starts by checking if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then the function returns `true` if `x` is also equal to 1, and `false` otherwise. This is because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself, so the only simple power of 1 is 1.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, then the function enters a loop that calculates the highest power of `n` that is less than or equal to `x`. This is done by initializing a variable called `power` to 1, and then repeatedly multiplying it by `n` until it is greater than or equal to `x`. At this point, the loop terminates and the function checks if `power` is equal to `x`. If it is, then `x` is a simple power of `n` and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, `x` is not a simple power of `n` and the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function uses several functions from the D standard library to implement this logic. The `std.typecons` module is used to define a tuple type called `Tuple`, which is not actually used in this code. The `std.math` module is used to define mathematical constants and functions, but none of these are used in this code either. The `std.algorithm` module is used to define generic algorithms, but none of these are used in this code either. The `std.conv` module is used to define functions for converting between types, but none of these are used in this code either. The `std.array` module is used to define functions for working with arrays, but none of these are used in this code either. The `std.range` module is used to define functions for working with ranges, but none of these are used in this code either. Finally, the `std.format` module is used to define functions for formatting strings, but none of these are used in this code either.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_simple_power(long x, long n) {\n"

Define the function `sorted_list_sum` that takes a list of strings `lst` as input and returns a sorted list of strings that have even length.\n3. Sort the input list `lst` in ascending order using the `sort` method.\n4. Create an empty list `new_lst`.\n5. Iterate over each string `i` in the sorted input list `lst`.\n6. Check if the length of the string `i` is even by using the modulo operator `%`.\n7. If the length of the string `i` is even, append it to the `new_lst` list using the `~=` operator.\n8. Sort the `new_lst` list in descending order of string length using the `sort` method with a lambda function that compares the length of two strings.\n9. Return the sorted `new_lst` list.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> sorted_list_sum(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

The first integer in the tuple is the number of even-length palindromes between 1 and n (inclusive), and the second integer is the number of odd-length palindromes between 1 and n (inclusive).\n\nThe function is called even_odd_palindrome and is defined using the D programming language.\n\nThe function starts by defining a nested function called is_palindrome. This function takes an integer n and returns true if n is a palindrome (i.e., if it reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise. The function converts the integer to a string using the to!string function, then checks if the string is equal to its reverse. The to!string function converts the integer to a string, and the .dup function creates a copy of the string. The .reverse function reverses the copy of the string, and the == operator checks if the original string is equal to the reversed copy.\n\nThe function then initializes two variables, even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count, to 0.\n\nThe function then iterates over the range 1 .. n+1 using a foreach loop. For each integer i in the range, the function checks if i is odd and a palindrome. If so, it increments odd_palindrome_count. If i is even and a palindrome, it increments even_palindrome_count.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count.\n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, you would need to replace the Tuple type with a std::tuple, and the tuple function with std::make_tuple. You would also need to replace the foreach loop with a for loop or a range-based for loop. Additionally, you would need to replace the D-specific functions (e.g., to!string, .dup, .reverse) with equivalent C++ functions or algorithms. The resulting C++ code would look quite different from the D code, but would perform the same computation. Here is an example of what the C++ code might look like:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::tuple<long, long> even_odd_palindrome(long n) {\n"

The function checks if the string `b` is a cyclic pattern of the string `a`. A cyclic pattern is a pattern that can be obtained by rotating the original string by some number of positions. For example, the string `abcabc` is a cyclic pattern of the string `abc`.\n\nThe function first calculates the length of the string `b` and then creates a new string `pat` by concatenating `b` with itself. This is done to handle the case where the cyclic pattern wraps around the end of the string. For example, if `a` is `abc` and `b` is `ab`, then the cyclic pattern is `abab`, which is obtained by concatenating `ab` with itself.\n\nThe function then iterates over all possible substrings of `a` that have the same length as `b`. For each substring, it checks if it matches any of the substrings of `pat` that have the same length as `b`. If a match is found, the function returns `true`. If no match is found after checking all possible substrings, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function uses several functions from the standard library of the D programming language to simplify the implementation. The `length` property is used to get the length of a string. The `~` operator is used to concatenate two strings. The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over the substrings of `a` and `pat`. The `range` module is used to generate a range of integers to iterate over. The `std.conv` module is used to convert between string and integer types. The `std.format` module is used to format strings. The `std.math` module is used to perform mathematical operations. The `std.string` module is used to manipulate strings. The `std.typecons` module is used to define a tuple type. The `std.array` module is used to manipulate arrays. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool cycpattern_check(std::string a, std::string b) {\n"

This is done to keep track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far. \n\nIf `max_sum` is 0, it means that all elements in the array are negative.

If the length is zero, the function returns an empty array.\n\nIf the length of the input array is not zero, the function sorts the array using the `sort` function from the `std.algorithm` module. The `sort` function takes a lambda function as an argument that defines the sorting order. The lambda function compares two elements of the array, `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether `a` should come before `b` in the sorted array.\n\nThe lambda function used in this implementation checks whether the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even or odd. If the sum is even, the lambda function returns `a > b`, which means that `a` should come before `b` in the sorted array. If the sum is odd, the lambda function returns `a < b`, which means that `b` should come before `a` in the sorted array.\n\nThe `numbers` argument passed to the lambda function is not defined in the code snippet provided and is likely a typo.\n\nThe sorted array is then returned by the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> sort_array(std::vector<long> array) {\n"

The function returns a string that describes the number of odd elements in each string of the input array.\n\nThe function uses the following D standard library modules:\n\n- `std.typecons`: provides a tuple type that can hold a fixed number of values of different types.\n- `std.math`: provides mathematical functions.\n- `std.algorithm`: provides algorithms for working with ranges.\n- `std.conv`: provides functions for converting between types.\n- `std.array`: provides functions for working with arrays.\n- `std.range`: provides functions for working with ranges.\n- `std.format`: provides functions for formatting strings.\n\nThe function starts by creating an empty array of strings called `res`. It then iterates over each string in the input array using a `foreach` loop. For each string, it counts the number of odd elements by using the `count` function from the `std.algorithm` module. The `count` function takes a range and a predicate function, and returns the number of elements in the range that satisfy the predicate. In this case, the predicate function is a lambda that checks if the integer representation of the character is odd.\n\nThe function then constructs a string that describes the number of odd elements in the input string, using the `~=` operator to append each part of the string together. The `to!string` function is used to convert the integer values to strings.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` array, which contains a string for each input string.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> odd_count(std::vector<std::string> lst) {\n"

The function takes two arguments: a list of strings and a prefix. The function returns a new list of strings that start with the given prefix.\n\nThe first line imports several modules from the standard library: `std.array`, `std.format`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.typecons`, `std.range`, and `std.math`. These modules provide various functions and utilities for working with arrays, strings, numbers, and other data types.\n\nThe second line defines a function called `filter_by_prefix` that takes two arguments: a list of strings called `strings` and a string called `prefix`. The function returns a new list of strings that start with the given prefix.\n\nThe third line uses the `filter` function from the `std.algorithm` module to filter the `strings` array. The `filter` function takes a predicate function as an argument and returns a new range that contains only the elements of the original range that satisfy the predicate. In this case, the predicate function is a lambda function that checks if a given string starts with the `prefix` string.\n\nThe fourth line converts the filtered range to an array using the `array` function from the `std.array` module. This is necessary because the `filter` function returns a range, which is a lazy view of the original range. Converting the range to an array forces the evaluation of the lazy view and creates a new array with the filtered elements.\n\nThe function then returns the filtered array of strings.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> filter_by_prefix(std::vector<std::string> strings, std::string prefix) {\n"

It returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\nThe function is written in a concise and readable way, using simple arithmetic operations and avoiding unnecessary variables. The function name is also descriptive and easy to understand.\n\nTo rewrite this program in C++, you would need to include the appropriate headers for the functions and data types used in the D program, and then write a similar function that calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the same formula. The syntax and semantics of the two languages are different, so some adjustments would be necessary, but the basic logic of the program would remain the same. \n\nHere is an example of how the program might look in C++:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong sum_to_n(long n) {\n"

If it is, then `running_max` is set to the current element `n`. Otherwise, `running_max` is set to the maximum value between `running_max` and `n`. \n\nThe maximum value is calculated using the `max` function from the `std.math` module. \n\nThe `result` array is then appended with the current `running_max` value using the `~=` operator. \n\nFinally, the `result` array is returned. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> rolling_max(std::vector<long> numbers) {\n"

The function takes two arrays of long integers, `game` and `guess`, and returns an array of long integers. The returned array contains the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the two input arrays.\n\nThe function first imports several modules from the D standard library: `std.typecons`, `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, and `std.format`.\n\nThe `compare` function takes two arrays of long integers, `game` and `guess`, as input. The `zip` function is used to create a range of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements of the two input arrays. The `map` function is then used to apply a lambda function to each tuple. The lambda function calculates the absolute difference between the two elements of the tuple using the `abs` function from the `std.math` module. The resulting range of absolute differences is then converted to an array using the `array` function from the `std.array` module. Finally, the array of absolute differences is returned.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> compare(std::vector<long> game, std::vector<long> guess) {\n"

Otherwise, it returns the index of the element that needs to be swapped to make the array sortable.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `ind` to -1. It then iterates over the array using a `foreach` loop. The loop starts at the second element of the array and continues until the end. For each element, the function checks if it is less than the previous element. If it is, the function sets `ind` to the index of the current element. If the array can be sorted, `ind` will remain -1. Otherwise, `ind` will be set to the index of the element that needs to be swapped.\n\nFinally, the function returns `ind`. If `ind` is -1, the array can be sorted. Otherwise, the array cannot be sorted by swapping at most one pair of elements, and the function returns the index of the element that needs to be swapped.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong can_arrange(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

These modules provide various functions and types that are used in the implementation of the function.\n\nThe `filter_by_substring` function uses the `filter` function from the `std.algorithm` module to filter the input array of strings. The `filter` function takes a predicate function as an argument and returns a range of elements that satisfy the predicate. In this case, the predicate function is defined using a lambda expression: `x => x.canFind(substring)`. The lambda expression takes a string `x` as an argument and returns `true` if the string contains the substring, and `false` otherwise. The `canFind` function is a member function of the `string` type that returns `true` if the string contains a given substring.\n\nThe `filter` function returns a range of elements that satisfy the predicate. The `array` function from the `std.array` module is used to convert the range to an array of strings.\n\nThe `filter_by_substring` function is called with an array of strings and a substring. The function returns an array of strings that contain the substring.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<std::string> filter_by_substring(std::vector<std::string> strings, std::string substring) {\n"

The function returns \"YES\" if the number of even integers in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the number of odd integers in `lst1`, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe function starts by using the `count` function from the `std.algorithm` module to count the number of odd and even integers in `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively. The `count` function takes a predicate function as an argument, which is used to determine whether an element should be counted or not. In this case, the predicate function checks whether an integer is odd or even by checking whether its remainder when divided by 2 is 1 or 0, respectively.\n\nThe function then returns \"YES\" if `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`, and \"NO\" otherwise. The `?:` operator is used to achieve this in a concise way. If `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`, the expression `\"YES\"` is returned, otherwise the expression `\"NO\"` is returned. The `?:` operator is a ternary operator that takes three operands: a condition, an expression to evaluate if the condition is true, and an expression to evaluate if the condition is false.\n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various modules from the standard library that are used in the implementation of the function. The `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, and `std.string` modules provide various functions for working with arrays, converting between data types, formatting strings, performing mathematical operations, working with ranges, and manipulating strings, respectively. The `std.typecons` module provides various type constructors, such as `std.typecons.Tuple`, which can be used to create tuples of values. However, this module is not used in the implementation of the `exchange` function.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string exchange(std::vector<long> lst1, std::vector<long> lst2) {\n"

The function takes an integer as input and returns a string containing the Roman numeral representation of the input.\n\nThe function is called `int_to_mini_roman` and takes a single argument, `number`, which is of type `long`.\n\nThe function begins by defining two arrays, `num` and `sym`, which contain the values and symbols used to represent Roman numerals. The `num` array contains the values of each Roman numeral, while the `sym` array contains the corresponding symbols.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable `i` to 12, which is the index of the largest Roman numeral in the `num` array (i.e. 1000). It also initializes an empty string `res`, which will be used to store the Roman numeral representation of the input.\n\nThe function then enters a loop that continues until `number` is zero. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the quotient of `number` divided by `num[i]` and stores it in a variable `div`. It then updates `number` to be the remainder of `number` divided by `num[i]`.\n\nThe function then enters another loop that executes `div` times. In each iteration of this loop, it appends the symbol corresponding to `num[i]` to the `res` string and decrements `div`.\n\nFinally, the function decrements `i` and repeats the loop until `number` is zero.\n\nThe function then returns the `res` string, which contains the Roman numeral representation of the input, converted to lowercase using the `toLower` function.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string int_to_mini_roman(long number) {\n"

This expression checks if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, and returns `true` if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses several standard D language modules, including `std.typecons`, `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, and `std.format`. These modules provide various functions and data types that can be used to perform common programming tasks.\n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and straightforward, and can be easily translated into C++ by replacing the D-specific syntax with equivalent C++ syntax. For example, the `long` data type can be replaced with `long long` in C++, and the `return` statement can be used in the same way as in D. The standard C++ libraries can be used to provide equivalent functionality to the D standard libraries.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_equal_to_sum_even(long n) {\n"

The function takes three arguments, which are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The function returns true if the triangle is a right angle triangle, and false otherwise.\n\nThe function works by checking whether the Pythagorean theorem holds for the triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, if a^2 = b^2 + c^2 or b^2 = a^2 + c^2 or c^2 = a^2 + b^2, then the triangle is a right angle triangle.\n\nThe function checks all three conditions and returns true if any of them is true. If none of the conditions is true, the function returns false.\n\nThe code uses several functions from the D standard library to make the implementation concise and readable. The import statements at the beginning of the code import the necessary modules.\n\nThe std.typecons module provides the Tuple type, which is used to return multiple values from the function. However, in this case, the function only returns a boolean value, so the Tuple type is not used.\n\nThe std.math module provides the pow function, which is used to calculate the squares of the sides of the triangle.\n\nThe std.algorithm module provides the max and min functions, which are used to find the maximum and minimum values among the sides of the triangle.\n\nThe std.conv module provides the to function, which is used to convert the sides of the triangle from strings to integers.\n\nThe std.array module provides the array function, which is used to create an array from the sides of the triangle.\n\nThe std.range module provides the iota function, which is used to create a range of values to iterate over.\n\nThe std.format module provides the format function, which is used to format the output string.\n\nOverall, the code is concise and easy to read, thanks to the use of the D standard library functions. To rewrite the code in C++, one would need to use the equivalent functions from the C++ standard library or implement them manually. The logic of the function, however, would remain the same.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool right_angle_triangle(long a, long b, long c) {\n"

If not, the function checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order by reversing the array using the `reverse` method and checking if the reversed array is sorted in non-descending order. If the array is sorted in non-increasing order, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses several functions and modules from the D standard library:\n\n- `std.algorithm`: provides algorithms for working with ranges, such as `isSorted` and `reverse`.\n- `std.array`: provides functions for working with arrays, such as `reverse`.\n- `std.conv`: provides functions for converting between types, such as `to`.\n- `std.format`: provides functions for formatting strings, such as `format`.\n- `std.math`: provides mathematical functions, such as `abs`.\n- `std.range`: provides functions for working with ranges, such as `stride`.\n- `std.string`: provides functions for working with strings, such as `join`.\n- `std.typecons`: provides type constructors, such as `Tuple`.\n\nTo rewrite the program in C++, you would need to replace the D-specific functions and modules with their C++ equivalents. For example, you could use the `std::is_sorted` function from the C++ standard library to check if the array is sorted, and the `std::reverse` function to reverse the array. You would also need to change the syntax for declaring and using arrays, and the syntax for returning a boolean value from the function.

The function returns true if the input is a perfect cube and false otherwise.\n\nThe function first takes the absolute value of the input using the `abs` function. This is done to ensure that the function works correctly for negative inputs.\n\nThe function then calculates the cube root of the input using the `pow` function from the `std.math` module. The `pow` function takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent. In this case, the base is the absolute value of the input and the exponent is 1.0/3.0, which is equivalent to taking the cube root.\n\nThe result of the `pow` function is then rounded to the nearest integer using the `round` function from the `std.math` module. This is done because the result of the `pow` function may not be an exact integer due to floating point imprecision.\n\nFinally, the result of raising the rounded cube root to the power of 3 is compared to the original input using the `^^` operator. The `^^` operator is the XOR operator in D, but in this case it is used as a comparison operator. If the two values are equal, the function returns true, indicating that the input is a perfect cube. Otherwise, the function returns false. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool iscube(long a) {\n"

The function takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are balanced or not.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable called `depth` to 0. It then iterates over each character in the input string using a `foreach` loop. For each character, it checks if it is an opening bracket (`<`). If it is, it increments the `depth` variable by 1. If it is a closing bracket (`>`), it decrements the `depth` variable by 1. If the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, so the function immediately returns `false`. If the loop completes without returning `false`, the function checks if the `depth` variable is 0, which means that the number of opening and closing brackets is equal, and returns `true` if it is, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThe code makes use of several functions from the D standard library, including `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`.

The function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list of numbers where the minimum value in the input list is mapped to 0, and the maximum value is mapped to 1. All other values are linearly scaled between 0 and 1.\n\nThe function is implemented in D, a programming language that is similar to C++. The code imports several modules from the D standard library, including `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.typecons`.\n\nThe `rescale_to_unit` function takes a single argument, `numbers`, which is a list of floating-point numbers. The function first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `minElement` and `maxElement` functions from the `std.algorithm` module. These functions return the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively.\n\nThe function then uses the `map` function from the `std.range` module to apply a lambda function to each element in the input list. The lambda function subtracts the minimum value from each element, and divides the result by the range of the input list (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). This maps the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 1, and linearly scales all other values between 0 and 1.\n\nFinally, the `array` function from the `std.array` module is used to convert the result of the `map` function back into an array of floating-point numbers, which is then returned by the `rescale_to_unit` function.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<float> rescale_to_unit(std::vector<float> numbers) {\n"

These values are stored in the variables `l` and `r`. \n\nThe length of the intersection of the two intervals is calculated by subtracting `l` from `r`. If the length is greater than zero and is a prime number, the function returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\". \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import various modules from the D standard library, including `std.math`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.array`, `std.range`, `std.format`, and `std.typecons`.

For example, you would need to replace `Tuple!(long, long)` with `std::pair<long, long>`, and `foreach` with a `for` loop. You would also need to replace the D-specific `import` statements with equivalent C++ `#include` statements for the appropriate header files. \n\nHere is an example of what the C++ code might look like:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string intersection(std::tuple<long, long> interval1, std::tuple<long, long> interval2) {\n"

The function checks if the input string contains any sentences that start with the string \"I \" (capital I followed by a space). If such a sentence exists, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.\n\nThe function first imports several modules from the D standard library: `std.algorithm`, `std.array`, `std.conv`, `std.format`, `std.math`, `std.range`, `std.string`, and `std.typecons`. These modules provide various utilities for working with strings, arrays, and other data types.\n\nThe function then defines a local variable `sentences` by splitting the input string `S` into an array of sentences using a regular expression. The regular expression matches any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The `split` function returns an array of strings, where each string represents a sentence from the input string.\n\nThe function then uses the `map` function from the `std.algorithm` module to apply a lambda function to each sentence in the `sentences` array. The lambda function checks if the sentence starts with the string \"I \" using the `startsWith` function from the `std.string` module. The `map` function returns an array of boolean values, where each value indicates whether the corresponding sentence starts with \"I \".\n\nFinally, the function uses the `reduce` function from the `std.algorithm` module to sum the boolean values in the array returned by `map`. The `reduce` function takes two arguments: a binary function that takes two arguments and returns a result, and an initial value for the reduction. In this case, the binary function is a lambda function that adds its two arguments, and the initial value is 0. The `reduce` function applies the binary function to each element in the array, starting with the initial value, and returns the final result. The final result is the number of sentences in the input string that start with \"I \", which is either 0 or 1. This result is returned as a long integer.<|im_end|>\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong is_bored(std::string S) {\n"

It does this by using the any function from the std.algorithm module, which returns true if any element in the input range satisfies a given predicate. The predicate in this case is a lambda function that takes an integer i and returns true if the value of count_digit[i] is greater than 2. \n\nIf any element in lst appears more than twice, the function returns false. \n\nIf lst does not contain any element that appears more than twice, the function checks whether lst is sorted using the isSorted property of the input array. If lst is sorted, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_sorted(std::vector<long> lst) {\n"

The function returns a string.\n\nThe function uses the `join` method of the array to concatenate all the strings in the array into a single string. The `join` method is called on line 6 with no arguments, which means that the default separator (which is the empty string) is used to join the strings.\n\nThe `join` method is a member function of the `string[]` type, which is an array of strings. It returns a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the array, separated by the specified separator.\n\nThe `join` method is defined in the `std.array` module, which is imported on line 1. The `std.array` module provides various functions and types for working with arrays.\n\nThe `concatenate` function is defined in the global namespace, which means that it can be called from anywhere in the program.\n\nThe program also imports several other modules, including `std.format`, `std.algorithm`, `std.conv`, `std.typecons`, `std.range`, and `std.math`. These modules provide various functions and types for working with strings, numbers, and other data types.\n\nOverall, the program is a simple implementation of a string concatenation function using the `join` method of the `string[]` type. The program is written in the D programming language, which is a high-level, garbage-collected, systems programming language with C-like syntax. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::string concatenate(std::vector<std::string> strings) {\n"

The function checks if the string contains at least two nested square brackets.\n\nThe first line of the code imports several modules from the D standard library. These modules provide various functions and data types that are used in the implementation of the `is_nested` function.\n\nThe `is_nested` function starts by declaring two empty arrays of type `long`, `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`. These arrays will be used to store the indices of opening and closing square brackets in the input string.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the input string using a `foreach` loop. If the current character is an opening square bracket (`[`), its index is appended to the `opening_bracket_index` array. If the current character is a closing square bracket (`]`), its index is appended to the `closing_bracket_index` array.\n\nAfter iterating over the entire input string, the `closing_bracket_index` array is reversed. This is done so that we can easily check if a closing bracket comes after its corresponding opening bracket.\n\nThe function then declares three variables of type `long`, `cnt`, `i`, and `l`. The `cnt` variable will be used to keep track of the number of nested square brackets, the `i` variable will be used to keep track of the index of the current closing bracket, and the `l` variable will be used to store the length of the `closing_bracket_index` array.\n\nThe function then iterates over each index in the `opening_bracket_index` array using another `foreach` loop. For each index, the function checks if there is a corresponding closing bracket that comes after it. If there is, the `cnt` variable is incremented and the `i` variable is incremented to the index of the next closing bracket.\n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if the `cnt` variable is greater than or equal to 2 (i.e., if there are at least two nested square brackets in the input string), and `false` otherwise.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nbool is_nested(std::string string) {\n"

The function returns a long integer.\n\nThe function `digits_sum` is defined inside `count_nums`. It takes one parameter `n` which is a long integer. The function returns a long integer.\n\nThe function `digits_sum` calculates the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`. It first checks if the input integer is negative. If it is, it multiplies it by -1 and sets a flag `neg` to -1. It then converts the integer to a string and splits it into an array of strings, each representing a digit. It then maps each string to a long integer and converts the resulting range to an array of long integers. It multiplies the first element of the array by the `neg` flag to restore the sign of the integer. It then returns the sum of the array.\n\nThe function `count_nums` applies the `digits_sum` function to each element of the input array using the `map` function. It then filters the resulting range to remove all elements that are less than or equal to 0 using the `filter` function. It then counts the number of elements in the resulting range using the `count` function and returns the count.\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) {\n"

The function calculates the minimum path from the top left corner of the grid to the bottom right corner of the grid, where the path is defined as the sum of the values of the cells visited along the path. The function returns an array of length `k` where the even-indexed elements are 1 and the odd-indexed elements are the minimum path value.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `val` to a value greater than the maximum possible path value. It then iterates over each cell in the grid, and if the cell value is 1, it calculates the minimum value of the adjacent cells and sets `val` to that value.\n\nThe function then initializes an empty array `ans` and iterates over `k` elements. If the index is even, it appends 1 to the `ans` array, otherwise it appends the value of `val`. Finally, the function returns the `ans` array.\n\nHere is the C++ version of the code:\n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> minPath(std::vector<std::vector<long>> grid, long k) {\n"

The function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. The function returns an array of `n` long integers.\n\nThe function creates an array of `n` integers using the `iota` function from the `std.range` module. The `iota` function generates a range of integers from `0` to `n-1`. The `map` function is then used to transform each integer in the range into a new integer using the lambda function `i => n + 2*i`. This lambda function takes an integer `i` and returns `n + 2*i`. The resulting range of transformed integers is then converted to an array using the `array` function from the `std.array` module.\n\nThe resulting array is then returned from the function. \n\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> make_a_pile(long n) {\n"
