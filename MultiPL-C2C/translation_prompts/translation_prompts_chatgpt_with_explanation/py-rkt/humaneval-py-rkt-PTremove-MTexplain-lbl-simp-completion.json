For each character, if it is an opening bracket (i.e. \"(\"), the `depth` variable is incremented by 1. If it is a closing bracket (i.e. \")\"), the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. If the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function immediately returns `False`. \n\nAfter iterating over all the characters in the string, the function checks whether the `depth` variable is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. If it is not, it means that there are still opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `False`.\n\nThe function takes a single argument, `brackets`, which is a string of brackets. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced. The function is defined using Python's function definition syntax, which starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name (`correct_bracketing`), and the function's parameters (`brackets: str`). The `-> bool` syntax indicates that the function returns a boolean value. \n\nThe `depth` variable is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. The loop iterates over each character in the `brackets` string using a `for` loop. The `if` statement checks whether the current character is an opening bracket (`(`). If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1 using the `+=` operator. If the current character is a closing bracket (`)`), the `depth` variable is decremented by 1 using the `-=` operator. The `if` statement inside the loop checks whether the `depth` variable is negative. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`. \n\nAfter the loop finishes, the function checks whether the `depth` variable is equal to 0 using the `==` operator. If it is, the function returns `True`. If it is not, the function returns `False`. \n\nOverall, the function checks whether a string of brackets is correctly balanced by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets seen so far. If the number of closing brackets ever exceeds the number of opening brackets, the function returns `False`. If the number of opening brackets without a corresponding closing bracket is greater than 0, the function also returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (correct_bracketing brackets)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_45_triangle_area", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (triangle_area a h)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_45_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate triangle_area))\n    (check-within (candidate 5 3) 7.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2) 2.0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 8) 40.0 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two arguments, `a` and `h`, which represent the base and height of the triangle respectively. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing the result by 2.0.

For example, if `n` is 3, the function calculates `1! * 2! * 3! = 1 * 2 * 6 = 12`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (special_factorial n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_136_largest_smallest_integers", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (largest_smallest_integers lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_136_largest_smallest_integers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate largest_smallest_integers))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 1 3 5 7)) (list #f 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 1 3 5 7 0)) (list #f 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 3 2 4 5 6 -2)) (list -2 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 4 5 3 6 2 7 -7)) (list -7 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 7 3 8 4 9 2 5 -9)) (list -9 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list #f #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0)) (list #f #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -3 -5 -6)) (list -1 #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -3 -5 -6 0)) (list -1 #f) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -6 -4 -4 -3 1)) (list -3 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -6 -4 -4 -3 -100 1)) (list -3 1) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the product of all the odd digits in the input integer `n`. If there are no odd digits in `n`, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables `product` and `odd_count` to 1 and 0 respectively. \n\nThe `for` loop iterates over each digit in the input integer `n`. The `str` function is used to convert the integer `n` to a string, which can then be iterated over. \n\nFor each digit in `n`, the `int` function is used to convert the digit back to an integer. If the integer is odd (i.e. the remainder of the integer divided by 2 is 1), the `product` variable is updated by multiplying it with the integer value of the digit, and the `odd_count` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nAfter the `for` loop, the function checks if `odd_count` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns the value of `product`. \n\nThe function uses type annotations to specify that the input parameter `n` is an integer, and that the return value is also an integer.

The function checks if the string contains three consecutive characters that are the same. If it does, the function returns False, otherwise it returns True.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the List class from the typing module. This is not used in the function, so it can be ignored.\n\nThe second line defines the `is_happy` function. It takes in a string `s` and returns a boolean value. The `-> bool` part of the line specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\nThe third line checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns False. This is because the function needs at least three characters to check for consecutive characters.\n\nThe fourth line starts a for loop that iterates over the string. The loop starts at the first character and ends at the third to last character. This is because the loop checks for three consecutive characters, and if it started at the last two characters, it would go out of bounds.\n\nThe fifth line checks if any of the three consecutive characters are the same. If they are, the function returns False.\n\nThe sixth line returns True if the loop completes without finding any consecutive characters.

The function returns the maximum number of containers required to fill the grid such that each container can hold at most `capacity` units of the grid. \n\nThe function first imports the `math` module and the `List` type from the `typing` module. \n\n`math` module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. \n\n`List` is a type hint that indicates that the variable is a list of integers. \n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword followed by the function name `max_fill`. The function takes two arguments, `grid` and `capacity`, and returns an integer. \n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that uses a list comprehension to calculate the maximum number of containers required to fill the grid. \n\nThe list comprehension iterates over each list `arr` in the `grid` and calculates the sum of the elements in the list. The `sum` function returns the sum of all the elements in the list. \n\nThe `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result of the division of the sum of the elements in the list by the `capacity`. This is done to ensure that each container can hold at most `capacity` units of the grid. \n\nThe `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the rounded up values for each list in the `grid`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of all the rounded up values, which is the maximum number of containers required to fill the grid.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (max_fill grid capacity)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_0_has_close_elements", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (has_close_elements numbers threshold)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_0_has_close_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate has_close_elements))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2) 0.3) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.9 4.0 5.0 2.2) 0.05) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0) 0.95) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 5.9 4.0 5.0) 0.8) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0) 0.1) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1) 1.0) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.1 2.2 3.1 4.1 5.1) 0.5) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function counts the number of integers in the input list that are greater than 10 and have odd digits in the first and last positions. \n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. The `List` class is a generic type that is used to represent a list of elements of a specific type. \n\nThe second line defines the `specialFilter` function that takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer. \n\nThe third line initializes a variable called `count` to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of integers that meet the criteria specified above.\n\nThe fourth line starts a `for` loop that iterates over each element in the input list. \n\nThe fifth line checks if the current element is greater than 10. If it is, the code proceeds to the next line. If it is not, the code skips the rest of the loop for this element and moves on to the next element in the list.\n\nThe sixth line initializes a tuple called `odd_digits` that contains the odd digits 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. \n\nThe seventh line converts the current element to a string and assigns it to a variable called `number_as_string`.\n\nThe eighth line checks if the first digit of the string representation of the current element is an odd digit and if the last digit of the string representation of the current element is an odd digit. If both conditions are true, the code proceeds to the next line. If either condition is false, the code skips the rest of the loop for this element and moves on to the next element in the list.\n\nThe ninth line increments the `count` variable by 1.\n\nThe tenth line ends the `for` loop.\n\nThe eleventh line returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the number of integers in the input list that meet the criteria specified above.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (specialFilter nums)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_17_parse_music", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_music music_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_17_parse_music.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate parse_music))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"o o o o\") (list 4 4 4 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \".| .| .| .|\") (list 1 1 1 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"o| o| .| .| o o o o\") (list 2 2 1 1 4 4 4 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"o| .| o| .| o o| o o|\") (list 2 1 2 1 4 2 4 2) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an empty tuple if either of the planets is not in the list of planet names or if the two planets are the same.\n\nThe function defines a tuple of planet names `planet_names` and checks if `planet1` and `planet2` are in the `planet_names` tuple and not the same. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an empty tuple.\n\nThe function then gets the index of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planet_names` tuple using the `index` method. If `planet1` comes before `planet2` in the tuple, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple from the index of `planet1` plus one to the index of `planet2`. If `planet2` comes before `planet1`, the function returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple from the index of `planet2` plus one to the index of `planet1`.\n\nThe function uses the `typing` module to specify the return type of the function as a tuple of strings.

This is used to specify the type of the `lst` argument.\n\nThe function initializes an empty list `result` which will be used to store the squares of the integers in the input list.\n\nThe function then iterates over the indices of the input list using the `range` function. For each index `i`, the function checks if `i` is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is divisible by 3, the function appends the square of the integer at that index to the `result` list using the `append` method.\n\nIf `i` is not divisible by 3, the function checks if `i` is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 3, the function appends the cube of the integer at that index to the `result` list using the `append` method.\n\nIf neither of the above conditions are met, the function appends the integer at that index to the `result` list using the `append` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the integers in the `result` list using the `sum` function.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (sum_squares lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_96_count_up_to", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (count_up_to n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_96_count_up_to.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate count_up_to))\n    (check-within (candidate 5) (list 2 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) (list 2 3 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7) (list 2 3 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) (list 2 3 5 7) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 0) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 22) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 18) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 47) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 101) (list 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns `True` if the input is a valid date and `False` otherwise.\n\n- `def valid_date(date: str) -> bool:` defines a function called `valid_date` that takes a string argument called `date` and returns a boolean value.\n\n- `try:` starts a try-except block.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Racket.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndef prod_signs(arr: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:\n    if not arr: return None\n    prod = 0 if 0 in arr else (-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))\n    return prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `prod_signs` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns an integer or None. \n\nThe first line imports the List and Optional types from the typing module. The List type is used to specify that the argument to the function is a list of integers, and the Optional type is used to specify that the return value of the function is either an integer or None.\n\nThe second line defines the function `prod_signs` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns an integer or None. \n\nThe third line checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns None.\n\nThe fourth line initializes a variable `prod` to 0 if the input list contains 0, otherwise it is set to (-1) raised to the power of the number of negative integers in the input list. This is done using a list comprehension that filters the input list for negative integers using a lambda function and the `filter` function, and then counts the number of negative integers using the `len` function.\n\nThe fifth line returns the product of `prod` and the sum of the absolute values of the integers in the input list. This is done using another list comprehension that takes the absolute value of each integer in the input list using the `abs` function, and then sums them using the `sum` function.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (prod_signs arr)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_49_modp", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (modp n p)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_49_modp.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate modp))\n    (check-within (candidate 3 5) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1101 101) 2 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 0 101) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3 11) 8 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 100 101) 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 30 5) 4 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 31 5) 3 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If `i` is prime, the function iterates over all integers between 2 and 100 (inclusive) using another `for` loop.

The `List` type is a generic type that represents a list of elements of any type, while the `Any` type represents any type. \n\nThe second line defines the `filter_integers` function, which takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers in the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to create the new list. \n\nThe list comprehension `[x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]` creates a new list by iterating over each element `x` in the `values` list and only including the element in the new list if it is an integer. The `isinstance` function is used to check if an element is an integer. \n\nThe function returns the new list containing only the integers in the original list. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that filters a list of values to only include integers.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (filter_integers values)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_94_skjkasdkd", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (skjkasdkd lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_94_skjkasdkd.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate skjkasdkd))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 3 2 1 3 5 7 4 5 5 5 2 181 32 4 32 3 2 32 324 4 3)) 10 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 0 1 8 2 4597 2 1 3 40 1 2 1 2 4 2 5 1)) 25 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 3 1 32 5107 34 83278 109 163 23 2323 32 30 1 9 3)) 13 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 724 32 71 99 32 6 0 5 91 83 0 5 6)) 11 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 81 12 3 1 21)) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0 8 1 2 1 7)) 7 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 8191)) 19 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 8191 123456 127 7)) 19 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 127 97 8192)) 10 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function first defines an inner function called `isPrime` that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is prime or not. \n\nThe `isPrime` function works by iterating over all integers from 2 to the square root of the input integer. If any of these integers divides the input integer without a remainder, then the input integer is not prime and the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, then the input integer is prime and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe outer function then initializes two variables: `maxx` and `i`. `maxx` is set to 0 and `i` is set to 0. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the input list. \n\nInside the while loop, the function checks whether the current element of the input list is greater than `maxx` and whether it is prime by calling the `isPrime` function. If both conditions are true, then `maxx` is set to the current element of the input list. The loop then increments `i` by 1 and continues to the next iteration.\n\nAfter the while loop completes, the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` by converting it to a string and then iterating over each character in the string and converting it to an integer. The sum of these integers is then returned as the result of the function.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (skjkasdkd lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_74_total_match", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (total_match lst1 lst2)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_74_total_match.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate total_match))\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hi\" \"hi\")) (list \"hi\" \"hi\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hi\" \"hi\" \"admin\" \"project\")) (list \"hi\" \"admin\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"4\") (list \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\")) (list \"4\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hI\" \"Hi\")) (list \"hI\" \"Hi\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hI\" \"hi\" \"hi\")) (list \"hI\" \"hi\" \"hi\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"hi\" \"admin\") (list \"hI\" \"hi\" \"hii\")) (list \"hi\" \"admin\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list ) (list \"this\")) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list \"this\") (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes two arguments `lst1` and `lst2`, both of which are lists of strings. The `->` symbol is used to specify the return type of the function, which is also a list of strings.\n\nThe next two lines initialize two variables `l1` and `l2` to zero. These variables will be used to store the total length of all strings in the input lists.\n\nThe first `for` loop iterates over each string in `lst1` and adds its length to `l1`.\n\nThe second `for` loop iterates over each string in `lst2` and adds its length to `l2`.\n\nThe `if` statement compares the total length of the strings in `lst1` and `lst2`. If `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`, the function returns `lst1`. Otherwise, it returns `lst2`. This means that if the total length of the strings in `lst1` is less than or equal to the total length of the strings in `lst2`, the function returns `lst1`.

The function first imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. The `List` class is a generic type that represents a list of items of a certain type. In this case, the type is `str`, which means that the list contains strings.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `sorted_list_sum`. The function takes one argument, `lst`, which is a list of strings. The `-> List[str]` notation indicates that the function returns a list of strings.\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n```\n\nThe next line sorts the input list in ascending order. The `sort()` method is called on the `lst` object, which sorts the list in place.\n\n```python\nlst.sort()\n```\n\nThe next line creates an empty list `new_lst`.\n\n```python\nnew_lst = []\n```\n\nThe following lines iterate over each string in the input list using a `for` loop. The loop variable `i` represents each string in the list.\n\n```python\nfor i in lst:\n```\n\nThe next line checks if the length of the current string is even. The `len()` function returns the length of the string, and the `%` operator is used to check if the length is even (i.e., the remainder of the length divided by 2 is 0).\n\n```python\nif len(i)%2 == 0:\n```\n\nIf the length of the string is even, the string is appended to the `new_lst` list.\n\n```python\nnew_lst.append(i)\n```\n\nFinally, the `sorted()` function is called on the `new_lst` list, with the `key` parameter set to `len`. This sorts the list by the length of each string in ascending order.\n\n```python\nreturn sorted(new_lst, key=len)\n```\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (sorted_list_sum lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_101_words_string", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (words_string s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_101_words_string.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate words_string))\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hi, my name is John\") (list \"Hi\" \"my\" \"name\" \"is\" \"John\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"One, two, three, four, five, six\") (list \"One\" \"two\" \"three\" \"four\" \"five\" \"six\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hi, my name\") (list \"Hi\" \"my\" \"name\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"One,, two, three, four, five, six,\") (list \"One\" \"two\" \"three\" \"four\" \"five\" \"six\") 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"ahmed     , gamal\") (list \"ahmed\" \"gamal\") 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `words_string` and it takes a string `s` as an argument. The function returns a list of strings.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. The `List` class is a generic type that represents a list of elements of a certain type. In this case, the type is `str`.\n\nThe second line of the code defines the `words_string` function. The function takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a list of strings. The `-> List[str]` syntax specifies the return type of the function.\n\nThe third line of the code checks if the string `s` is empty. If the string is empty, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe fourth line of the code initializes an empty list `s_list`.\n\nThe fifth line of the code starts a `for` loop that iterates over each character in the string `s`.\n\nThe sixth line of the code checks if the current character is a comma. If the character is a comma, the code appends a space to the `s_list` list. If the character is not a comma, the code appends the character to the `s_list` list.\n\nThe seventh line of the code joins the characters in the `s_list` list into a single string. The `join` method is called on an empty string `\"\"` and the `s_list` list is passed as an argument. This concatenates all the characters in the `s_list` list into a single string.\n\nThe eighth line of the code splits the string into a list of words. The `split` method is called on the string and it splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace characters. The resulting list of words is returned by the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (words_string s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_107_even_odd_palindrome", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (even_odd_palindrome n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_107_even_odd_palindrome.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate even_odd_palindrome))\n    (check-within (candidate 123) (list 8 13) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12) (list 4 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3) (list 1 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 63) (list 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 25) (list 5 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 19) (list 4 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 9) (list 4 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) (list 0 1) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function counts the number of even and odd palindromic numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and returns the counts as a tuple.\n\nThe function has an inner function called `is_palindrome` that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. The function converts the integer to a string and checks if the string is equal to its reverse.\n\nThe function initializes two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to zero. These variables will be used to count the number of even and odd palindromic numbers respectively.\n\nThe function then loops through the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop. For each integer `i` in the range, the function checks if `i` is odd and a palindrome. If it is, the `odd_palindrome_count` variable is incremented by 1. If `i` is even and a palindrome, the `even_palindrome_count` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of the two counts `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (even_odd_palindrome n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_71_triangle_area", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (triangle_area a b c)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_71_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate triangle_area))\n    (check-within (candidate 3 4 5) 6.0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2 10) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4 8 5) 8.18 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 2) 1.73 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2 3) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 5 7) 16.25 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 6 3) -1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 1 1) 0.43 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 10) -1 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes in three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` and returns a float value representing the area of the triangle. \n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n```\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `triangle_area`. The function takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns a float value. The `->` symbol is used to indicate the return type of the function.\n\n```python\nif a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n    return -1 \n```\nThe first line of the function checks if the input values can form a valid triangle. If the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side, then the input values cannot form a triangle. In this case, the function returns -1 to indicate that the input is invalid.\n\n```python\ns = (a + b + c)/2    \n```\nIf the input values can form a valid triangle, the function calculates the semi-perimeter `s` of the triangle using the formula `(a + b + c)/2`. The semi-perimeter is used in the next line to calculate the area of the triangle.\n\n```python\narea = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5\n```\nThe area of the triangle is calculated using Heron's formula, which is given by `sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`. The formula calculates the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides. \n\n```python\narea = round(area, 2)\n```\nThe area of the triangle is rounded to two decimal places using the `round()` function.\n\n```python\nreturn area\n```\nFinally, the function returns the calculated area of the triangle.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (triangle_area a b c)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_95_check_dict_case", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (check_dict_case dict)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_95_check_dict_case.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate check_dict_case))\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"p\" .  \"pineapple\") (\"b\" .  \"banana\"))) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"p\" .  \"pineapple\") (\"A\" .  \"banana\") (\"B\" .  \"banana\"))) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"p\" .  \"pineapple\") (\"5\" .  \"banana\") (\"a\" .  \"apple\"))) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"Name\" .  \"John\") (\"Age\" .  \"36\") (\"City\" .  \"Houston\"))) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"STATE\" .  \"NC\") (\"ZIP\" .  \"12345\"))) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash((\"fruit\" .  \"Orange\") (\"taste\" .  \"Sweet\"))) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate #hash()) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes a dictionary as an argument and returns a boolean value.\n\nThe function starts by importing the `Dict` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the argument passed to the function.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\n```\n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `check_dict_case`, and the argument `dict` which is of type `Dict[str, str]`. The `-> bool` specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\n```python\ndef check_dict_case(dict: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:\n```\n\nThe function checks if the dictionary is empty. If it is, the function returns `False`.\n\n```python\n    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:\n        return False\n```\n\nIf the dictionary is not empty, the function initializes a variable `state` to `\"start\"`. The variable `state` is used to keep track of the case of the keys in the dictionary.\n\n```python\n    else:\n        state = \"start\"\n```\n\nThe function then iterates over the keys in the dictionary using a `for` loop.\n\n```python\n        for key in dict.keys():\n```\n\nFor each key, the function checks if it is a string. If it is not a string, the variable `state` is set to `\"mixed\"` and the loop is broken.\n\n```python\n            if isinstance(key, str) == False:\n                state = \"mixed\"\n                break\n```\n\nIf the key is a string, the function checks the case of the key. If the variable `state` is `\"start\"`, the function checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase. If the key is uppercase, the variable `state` is set to `\"upper\"`. If the key is lowercase, the variable `state` is set to `\"lower\"`. If the key is neither uppercase nor lowercase, the loop is broken.\n\n```python\n            if state == \"start\":\n                if key.isupper():\n                    state = \"upper\"\n                elif key.islower():\n                    state = \"lower\"\n                else:\n                    break\n```\n\nIf the variable `state` is not `\"start\"`, the function checks if the case of the key matches the case of the previous keys.

The sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of all the natural numbers from 1 up to that number. For example, the first 5 numbers in the sequence are 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15.\n\nThe function `tri` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` numbers from the Triangular Number Sequence. \n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the output of the `tri` function.\n\nThe `tri` function starts with an `if` statement that checks if the input `n` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns a list with a single element, 1. This is because the first number in the Triangular Number Sequence is always 1.\n\nIf `n` is not 0, the function creates a list called `my_tri` with the first two numbers of the sequence, 1 and 3.\n\nThe function then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). \n\nInside the loop, the function checks if the current iteration number `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the function appends `(i / 2) + 1` to the `my_tri` list. This is because the formula for the `i`th even number in the sequence is `(i / 2) * (i + 1)`. \n\nIf `i` is odd, the function appends the sum of the previous two numbers in the `my_tri` list, plus `(i + 3) / 2`. This is because the formula for the `i`th odd number in the sequence is `((i + 1) / 2) * (i + 2)`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `my_tri` list.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (tri n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_47_median", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (median l)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_47_median.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate median))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 1 2 4 5)) 3 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -10 4 6 1000 10 20)) 8.0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5)) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 6 5)) 5.5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 8 1 3 9 9 2 7)) 7 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Racket.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef minSubArraySum(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    max_sum = 0\n    s = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        s += -num\n        if (s < 0):\n            s = 0\n        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)\n    if max_sum == 0:\n        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)\n    min_sum = -max_sum\n    return min_sum\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `minSubArraySum` that takes in a list of integers called `nums` and returns an integer. The function calculates the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray of `nums`. \n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `nums` parameter as a list of integers.\n\nThe second line defines the function `minSubArraySum` that takes in a list of integers called `nums` and returns an integer. \n\nThe third line initializes a variable called `max_sum` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of `nums`.\n\nThe fourth line initializes a variable called `s` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the current sum of the contiguous subarray being considered.\n\nThe fifth line starts a loop that iterates over each element `num` in the `nums` list.\n\nThe sixth line subtracts `num` from `s` and assigns the result back to `s`. This is equivalent to adding `-num` to `s`. \n\nThe seventh line checks if `s` is less than 0. If it is, then `s` is set to 0. This is because if the current sum of the contiguous subarray being considered is negative, then it is better to start over with a new subarray that has a positive sum.\n\nThe eighth line updates `max_sum` to be the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`. This is because `s` is the current sum of the contiguous subarray being considered, and `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray seen so far.\n\nThe ninth line checks if `max_sum` is 0. If it is, then it means that all the elements in `nums` are negative. In this case, `max_sum` is set to the maximum negative element in `nums`.\n\nThe tenth line calculates `min_sum` as the negative of `max_sum`. This is because the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray is the negative of the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.\n\nThe eleventh line returns `min_sum`, which is the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray of `nums`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (minSubArraySum nums)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_88_sort_array", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (sort_array array)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_88_sort_array.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate sort_array))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5)) (list 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 3 0 1 5)) (list 0 1 2 3 4 5) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 3 0 1 5 6)) (list 6 5 4 3 2 1 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 1)) (list 1 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 15 42 87 32 11 0)) (list 0 11 15 32 42 87) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 21 14 23 11)) (list 23 21 14 11) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `List` type is a generic type that represents a list of elements of a particular type. \n\nThe second line defines a function called `sort_array` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a sorted list of integers. \n\nThe third line is a conditional expression that checks if the length of the input array is zero. If the length of the array is zero, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the `sorted` function is called on the input array with the `reverse` parameter set to a boolean value that is determined by the result of an expression. \n\nThe expression `(array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0` calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the input array and checks if the result is even. If the result is even, the `reverse` parameter is set to `True`, which sorts the array in descending order. Otherwise, the `reverse` parameter is set to `False`, which sorts the array in ascending order. \n\nIn summary, the `sort_array` function takes an array of integers, checks if the array is empty, and returns a sorted array of integers in either ascending or descending order depending on the sum of the first and last elements of the input array.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (sort_array array)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_111_histogram", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (histogram test)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_111_histogram.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate histogram))\n    (check-within (candidate \"a b b a\") #hash((\"a\" .  2) (\"b\" .  2)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a b c a b\") #hash((\"a\" .  2) (\"b\" .  2)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a b c d g\") #hash((\"a\" .  1) (\"b\" .  1) (\"c\" .  1) (\"d\" .  1) (\"g\" .  1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"r t g\") #hash((\"r\" .  1) (\"t\" .  1) (\"g\" .  1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"b b b b a\") #hash((\"b\" .  4)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"r t g\") #hash((\"r\" .  1) (\"t\" .  1) (\"g\" .  1)) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") #hash() 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a\") #hash((\"a\" .  1)) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe function `get_odd_collatz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of odd numbers that are generated by the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, an empty list `odd_collatz` is created. If `n` is odd, a list `odd_collatz` is created with `n` as its only element. \n\nThe function then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. In each iteration of the loop, the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, `n` is divided by 2. If `n` is odd, `n` is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to the result. If the resulting number is odd, it is appended to the `odd_collatz` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `odd_collatz` list sorted in ascending order. \n\nThe `typing` module is imported at the beginning of the code to allow type hints to be used in the function signature. The `List` type hint indicates that the function returns a list of integers. The `int` type hint indicates that the input parameter `n` is an integer. \n\nThe `sorted` function is used to sort the `odd_collatz` list in ascending order before it is returned.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (get_odd_collatz n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_62_derivative", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (derivative xs)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_62_derivative.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate derivative))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 1 2 4 5)) (list 1 4 12 20) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3)) (list 2 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1)) (list 2 2) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1 0 4)) (list 2 2 0 16) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1)) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `enumerate` function is used to get the index of each coefficient, which is used as the power of `x`.

The function first imports the `math` module. \n\nThe function `is_prime` is defined within `prime_fib`. It takes an integer `p` and returns `True` if `p` is prime, and `False` otherwise. If `p` is less than 2, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function checks if `p` is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `p`, inclusive. If `p` is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime, so the function returns `False`. If `p` is not divisible by any of these integers, it is prime, so the function returns `True`.\n\nThe function initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two numbers, 0 and 1, in a list `f`. It then enters a loop that appends the sum of the last two numbers in `f` to `f`. If the last number in `f` is prime, `n` is decremented. If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the last number in `f`. \n\nOverall, the function generates the Fibonacci sequence and checks if each number in the sequence is prime until it reaches the `n`th prime number in the sequence. The function then returns that prime number.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (prime_fib n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_8_sum_product", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (sum_product numbers)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_8_sum_product.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate sum_product))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list 0 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 1 1)) (list 3 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 100 0)) (list 100 0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 5 7)) (list 15 105) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 10)) (list 10 10) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a number based on the values of `x` and `y` as follows:\n\n1. If `x` is greater than `y`, return `-1`.\n2. If `y` is even, return `y`.\n3. If `x` is equal to `y`, return `-1`.\n4. Otherwise, return `y - 1`.\n\nThe function definition starts with `def choose_num(x: int, y: int) -> int:`. This line defines the function name, `choose_num`, and its arguments, `x` and `y`. The `-> int` part indicates that the function returns an integer.\n\nThe first line of the function body is `if x > y:`, which checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, the function returns `-1`.\n\nThe second line of the function body is `if y % 2 == 0:`, which checks if `y` is even. If it is, the function returns `y`.\n\nThe third line of the function body is `if x == y:`, which checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If it is, the function returns `-1`.\n\nThe last line of the function body is `return y - 1`, which returns `y - 1` if none of the previous conditions are met. This line is executed only if `x` is less than `y`, `y` is odd, and `x` is not equal to `y`. \n\nOverall, the function returns `-1` if `x` is greater than `y` or if `x` is equal to `y`. Otherwise, it returns `y` if `y` is even, and `y - 1` if `y` is odd and `x` is less than `y`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (choose_num x y)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_82_prime_length", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (prime_length string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_82_prime_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate prime_length))\n    (check-within (candidate \"Hello\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"abcdcba\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"kittens\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"orange\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"wow\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"world\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"MadaM\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Wow\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"HI\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"go\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"gogo\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Madam\") #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"M\") #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"0\") #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, `do_algebra`, and the input arguments enclosed in parentheses. The `->` symbol is used to indicate the return type of the function, which is `int`.\n\nThe first line of the function imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to indicate that the `operator` and `operand` arguments are lists.\n\nThe second line of the function initializes a variable `expression` to a string representation of the first element of the `operand` list.\n\nThe third line of the function starts a `for` loop that iterates over the `operator` and `operand` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function. The `zip` function returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the input iterables. In this case, it aggregates the elements of `operator` and `operand[1:]`, which is a slice of the `operand` list starting from the second element. This is done to match the number of operators with the number of operands.\n\nThe fourth line of the function concatenates the current operator and operand to the `expression` variable using the `+=` operator. The `str` function is used to convert the operand to a string before concatenation.\n\nThe fifth line of the function uses the `eval` function to evaluate the `expression` string as a Python expression and return the result as an integer. The `eval` function takes a string as input and evaluates it as a Python expression. In this case, the expression is a string representation of a mathematical expression, such as \"2+3*4\", which is evaluated to 14. The `eval` function is a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous if used improperly, as it can execute arbitrary code. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only with trusted input.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (do_algebra operator operand)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_118_get_closest_vowel", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (get_closest_vowel word)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_118_get_closest_vowel.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate get_closest_vowel))\n    (check-within (candidate \"yogurt\") \"u\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"full\") \"u\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"easy\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"eAsy\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"ali\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"bad\") \"a\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"most\") \"o\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"ab\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"ba\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"quick\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"anime\") \"i\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Asia\") \"\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"Above\") \"o\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns `True` if the two strings have the same characters, regardless of order. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe function uses the `set` data type to compare the characters in the two strings. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. The `set` function takes a string as input and returns a set of the unique characters in the string. If the sets of the two input strings are equal, then the two strings have the same characters.\n\nThe `-> bool` syntax after the function signature indicates that the function returns a boolean value. This is a type hint, which is a way to indicate the expected types of the function's arguments and return value. Type hints are not enforced by the Python interpreter, but they can be used by tools like linters and IDEs to provide better code analysis and autocomplete suggestions.\n\nThe `def` keyword is used to define a function in Python. The function name is `same_chars`, and it takes two arguments, `s0` and `s1`, both of which are of type `str`. The `:` after the argument list indicates the start of the function body.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that uses the `set` function to compare the characters in the two input strings. The `==` operator is used to compare the sets for equality, and the result is returned by the function using the `return` keyword.\n\nOverall, the function is a concise and efficient way to check if two strings have the same characters, regardless of order. It uses the built-in `set` function to perform the comparison, which takes advantage of the set's unique element property to eliminate duplicates and order dependence.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (same_chars s0 s1)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (parse_nested_parens paren_string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate parse_nested_parens))\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\") (list 2 3 1 3) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"() (()) ((())) (((())))\") (list 1 2 3 4) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"(()(())((())))\") (list 4) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Racket.\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    def xor(i, j):\n        if i == j:\n            return '0'\n        else:\n            return '1'\n\n    return ''.join(xor(x, y) for x, y in zip(a, b))\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function `string_xor` that takes in two strings `a` and `b` and returns a string that is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two input strings.\n\nThe first line of the code imports the `List` class from the `typing` module. The `List` class is a generic type that is used to represent a list of elements of a particular type. It is used in this code to specify the type of the input arguments of the `string_xor` function.\n\nThe second line of the code defines the `string_xor` function that takes in two arguments `a` and `b`, both of type `str`, and returns a string. The `-> str` notation specifies the return type of the function.\n\nThe third line of the code defines a nested function `xor` that takes in two arguments `i` and `j` and returns a string that is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two input strings. If the two input strings are equal, the function returns the string '0', otherwise it returns the string '1'.\n\nThe fourth line of the code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the two input strings `a` and `b` in parallel using the `zip` function. For each pair of characters `(x, y)` in the two input strings, the `xor` function is called with `x` and `y` as arguments, and the resulting string is added to a list. The `join` method is then called on the list to concatenate all the strings in the list into a single string, which is then returned as the result of the `string_xor` function.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (string_xor a b)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_23_strlen", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (strlen string)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_23_strlen.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate strlen))\n    (check-within (candidate \"\") 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"x\") 1 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"asdasnakj\") 9 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `-> str` is a type hint that specifies the return type of the function.\n\n2. `suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']` - This line creates a list `suf` that contains three strings: `'txt'`, `'exe'`, and `'dll'`. These are the allowed file extensions.\n\n3. `lst = file_name.split(sep='.')` - This line splits the input string `file_name` into a list `lst` using the period (`.`) as a separator.\n\n4. `if len(lst) != 2:` - This line checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. If it is not, it means that the input string does not have exactly one period, so it is not a valid file name. The function returns `'No'`.\n\n5. `if not lst[1] in suf:` - This line checks if the second element of `lst` (which should be the file extension) is not in the list of allowed file extensions `suf`. If it is not, it means that the file extension is not allowed, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n6. `if len(lst[0]) == 0:` - This line checks if the length of the first element of `lst` (which should be the file name) is zero. If it is, it means that the file name is empty, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n7. `if not lst[0][0].isalpha():` - This line checks if the first character of the first element of `lst` (which should be the first character of the file name) is not an alphabetic character. If it is not, it means that the file name does not start with an alphabetic character, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n8. `t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])` - This line creates a list of all the digits in the first element of `lst` and assigns the length of that list to the variable `t`.\n\n9. `if t > 3:` - This line checks if the number of digits in the file name is greater than 3. If it is, it means that the file name has too many digits, so the function returns `'No'`.\n\n10. `return 'Yes'` - This line is reached if all the previous checks have passed, which means that the input string is a valid file name.

If there are multiple strings with the same number of unique characters, the function returns the lexicographically smallest string.\n\nThe function is defined with the name `find_max` and takes a single argument `words`, which is a list of strings. The function returns a single string.\n\nThe first line of the function imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `words` argument.\n\nThe second line of the function defines the function signature. The function takes a list of strings as input and returns a string. The `->` symbol is used to specify the return type.\n\nThe third line of the function sorts the input list of strings using the `sorted` function. The `key` argument is used to specify the sorting criteria. The sorting criteria is a lambda function that takes a single argument `x` and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the negative length of the set of unique characters in the string `x`. The negative sign is used to sort the list in descending order of the length of the set of unique characters. The second element of the tuple is the string `x` itself. This is used to break ties in case there are multiple strings with the same number of unique characters.\n\nThe fourth line of the function returns the first element of the sorted list, which is the string with the maximum number of unique characters.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (find_max words)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_163_generate_integers", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (generate_integers a b)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_163_generate_integers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate generate_integers))\n    (check-within (candidate 2 10) (list 2 4 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 2) (list 2 4 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 132 2) (list 2 4 6 8) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 17 89) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `number` variable is then updated to the remainder of the integer division of `number` and the current value in the `num` list, and the process is repeated until `number` is equal to 0. The resulting string is then returned in lowercase.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (int_to_mini_roman number)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_138_is_equal_to_sum_even", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_equal_to_sum_even n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_138_is_equal_to_sum_even.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_equal_to_sum_even))\n    (check-within (candidate 4) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 12) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 13) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 16) #t 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined with two arguments `x` and `n`, both of which are of type `str`. The function returns a boolean value that is either `True` or `False`. \n\nThe first line of the function definition specifies the types of the input arguments and the return value. The `->` operator is used to specify the return type of the function. In this case, the function takes two arguments, both of which are strings, and returns a boolean value.\n\nThe second line of the function definition unpacks the two input strings `x` and `n` into two variables `a` and `b`, and `c` and `d` respectively. The `split()` method is used to split the strings at the `/` character and assign the resulting substrings to the variables.\n\nThe third line of the function definition calculates the numerator of a fraction by multiplying the integer values of `a` and `c`. The fourth line calculates the denominator of the fraction by multiplying the integer values of `b` and `d`.\n\nThe fifth line of the function definition checks if the numerator divided by the denominator is equal to the integer value of the numerator divided by the denominator. If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nIn summary, the `simplify` function takes two strings that represent fractions, calculates the product of the two fractions, and checks if the result can be simplified to an integer. If the result can be simplified to an integer, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (simplify x n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_161_solve", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (solve s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_161_solve.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate solve))\n    (check-within (candidate \"AsDf\") \"aSdF\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"1234\") \"4321\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"ab\") \"AB\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"#a@C\") \"#A@c\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"#AsdfW^45\") \"#aSDFw^45\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"#6@2\") \"2@6#\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"#$a^D\") \"#$A^d\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"#ccc\") \"#CCC\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined with the input argument `s` of type string and the output argument of type string. \n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables `flg` and `idx` to 0 and creating a new list `new_str` which is a copy of the input string `s`. \n\nThe function then iterates through each character in the input string `s` using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if it is an alphabet using the `isalpha()` method. If the character is an alphabet, it swaps the case of the character using the `swapcase()` method and stores the result in the corresponding position in the `new_str` list. It also sets the `flg` variable to 1 to indicate that at least one alphabet was found in the input string. The `idx` variable is incremented to keep track of the current position in the input string.\n\nAfter the `for` loop, the function creates an empty string `s` and iterates through each character in the `new_str` list using another `for` loop. For each character, it appends the character to the `s` string.\n\nThe function then checks if the `flg` variable is still 0. If it is, it means that no alphabets were found in the input string. In this case, it returns the reverse of the `s` string using the slicing notation `s[len(s)::-1]`. If `flg` is not 0, it means that at least one alphabet was found in the input string and the function returns the `s` string as is.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (solve s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_157_right_angle_triangle", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (right_angle_triangle a b c)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_157_right_angle_triangle.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate right_angle_triangle))\n    (check-within (candidate 3 4 5) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 2 3) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 6 8) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 2) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7 24 25) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 10 5 7) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5 12 13) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 15 8 17) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 48 55 73) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1 1 1) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 2 2 10) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function takes three integer arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe function returns `True` if the square of one side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThe function checks this condition for each of the three sides of the triangle using the `or` operator. If any of the conditions are true, the function returns `True`. If none of the conditions are true, the function returns `False`.\n\nThe function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function (`right_angle_triangle`), and the arguments it takes (`a`, `b`, and `c`). The `-> bool` syntax after the argument list specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that returns the result of the boolean expression that checks whether the triangle is a right angle triangle. The expression is composed of three parts, each of which checks whether one of the sides of the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. The `==` operator is used to compare the square of one side to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The `or` operator is used to combine the three conditions into a single boolean expression. \n\nThe function returns the result of this expression using the `return` keyword. If the expression is true, the function returns `True`. If the expression is false, the function returns `False`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (right_angle_triangle a b c)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_151_double_the_difference", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (double_the_difference lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_151_double_the_difference.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate double_the_difference))\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5.0 4.0)) 25 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0.1 0.2 0.3)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -10.0 -20.0 -30.0)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1.0 -2.0 8.0)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 0.2 3.0 5.0)) 34 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -9.0 -7.0 -5.0 -3.0 -1.0 1.0 3.0 5.0 7.0 9.0)) 165 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Assign `b` to `a` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` to `b`.\n3. Return `a`.\n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. The `while` loop in the code implements this process. The variables `a` and `b` are updated in each iteration of the loop to be the smaller and larger numbers respectively. The `%` operator is used to calculate the remainder. The `return` statement returns the last non-zero remainder, which is the greatest common divisor.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (greatest_common_divisor a b)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_106_f", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (f n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_106_f.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate f))\n    (check-within (candidate 5) (list 1 2 6 24 15) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 7) (list 1 2 6 24 15 720 28) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) (list 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 3) (list 1 2 6) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

For each character, if it is an opening bracket (i.e. \"<\"), the depth is incremented by 1. If it is a closing bracket (i.e. \">\"), the depth is decremented by 1. If the depth ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. \n\nAfter iterating through all the characters, if the depth is 0, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns False. \n\nThe function takes in a single argument, `brackets`, which is a string of brackets. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the brackets are correctly balanced. \n\nThe function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name (`correct_bracketing`), and the function arguments (`brackets: str`). The `-> bool` after the argument list indicates that the function returns a boolean. \n\nThe `depth` variable is initialized to 0 before the loop. \n\nThe loop iterates through each character in the `brackets` string using a for loop. The loop variable `b` takes on the value of each character in turn. \n\nThe if statement checks whether the current character is an opening bracket (\"<\"). If it is, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1. \n\nThe else statement is executed if the current character is not an opening bracket (i.e. it must be a closing bracket). In this case, the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. \n\nThe second if statement checks whether the `depth` variable is negative. If it is, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. \n\nAfter the loop, the function checks whether the `depth` variable is 0. If it is, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns False. \n\nOverall, the function checks whether a string of brackets is correctly balanced by keeping track of the depth of the brackets (i.e. the number of opening brackets minus the number of closing brackets) and returning False if the depth ever becomes negative.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (correct_bracketing brackets)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_21_rescale_to_unit", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (rescale_to_unit numbers)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_21_rescale_to_unit.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate rescale_to_unit))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2.0 49.9)) (list 0.0 1.0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 100.0 49.9)) (list 1.0 0.0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0)) (list 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2.0 1.0 5.0 3.0 4.0)) (list 0.25 0.0 1.0 0.5 0.75) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 12.0 11.0 15.0 13.0 14.0)) (list 0.25 0.0 1.0 0.5 0.75) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an integer value.\n\nThe function initializes a variable called `times` to 0.\n\nThe function then enters a for loop that iterates over a range of values from 0 to the length of `string` minus the length of `substring` plus 1. This is done to ensure that the loop does not go out of bounds when checking for the substring in the string.\n\nWithin the for loop, the function checks if the substring is present in the string by comparing a slice of the string from the current index to the current index plus the length of the substring to the substring itself. If the two are equal, the `times` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `times`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (how_many_times string substring)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_121_solution", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (solution lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_121_solution.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate solution))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 8 7 1)) 12 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 3 3 3 3)) 9 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 30 13 24 321)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 9)) 5 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 2 4 8)) 0 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 30 13 23 32)) 23 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 13 2 9)) 3 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The first line imports the List class from the typing module. This is used to specify the type of the input parameter lst as a List of integers.\n\n2. The second line defines a function called solution that takes a single parameter lst, which is of type List[int], and returns an integer.\n\n3. The third line returns the sum of a list comprehension. A list comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying some operation to each element. In this case, the operation is to include the element in the new list if it is odd and at an even index. \n\n4. The list comprehension is constructed as follows:\n    - [x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1]\n    - This creates a new list by iterating over lst and including each element x if the following conditions are met:\n        - idx%2==0: the index of the element is even\n        - x%2==1: the element itself is odd\n    - The enumerate function is used to get both the index and the element at each iteration.\n\n5. The sum function is then called on the resulting list to get the sum of all the odd numbers at even indices.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (solution lst)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_126_is_sorted", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_sorted lst)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_126_is_sorted.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_sorted))\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 3 2 4 5)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 3 2 4 5 6 7)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 3 2 1)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 2 2 3 4)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 3 3 4)) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 2 3 3 4)) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 1 2 3 4)) #t 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The formula used is `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`. \n\n- `10 ** (n - 2)` calculates 10 to the power of `n - 2`. This is because if `n` is 2, we want to calculate the number of integers between 1 and 10^2 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. There are 10 integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1, and 10^2 is 100, so we need to multiply by 10 to get the correct number of integers. Similarly, if `n` is 3, we want to calculate the number of integers between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. There are 100 integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that start with the digit 1, so we need to multiply by 100 to get the correct number of integers. In general, we need to multiply by 10^(n-2) to get the correct number of integers.\n\n- `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))` calculates the number of integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. This is because there are 9 digits that can follow the digit 1 (0-9), and each of these digits can be followed by any of the remaining `n-1` digits. So there are `9 * (n-1)` integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1. However, we need to add the 1 integer that starts with 1 and has `n-1` digits (e.g. if `n` is 3, the integer 100 starts with 1 and has 2 digits). So the total number of integers between 1 and 10^n (inclusive) that start with the digit 1 is `9 * (n-1) + 1`, which simplifies to `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (starts_one_ends n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_30_get_positive", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (get_positive l)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_30_get_positive.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate get_positive))\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -2 4 5 6)) (list 4 5 6) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list 5 3 -5 2 3 3 9 0 123 1 -10)) (list 5 3 2 3 3 9 123 1) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list -1 -2)) (list ) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate (list )) (list ) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `sum` function adds up all the digits of `N` by converting each digit to an integer and then summing them up. The `int` function converts each digit of `N` to an integer. The `str` function converts the integer `N` to a string so that each digit can be accessed.

The function finds the minimum path from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner, where the path is defined as the sum of the values of the cells visited. The function returns a list of `k` integers, where the first `k` elements of the minimum path are repeated alternately.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\nImporting the `List` class from the `typing` module. This is used to specify the type of the `grid` parameter and the return value of the function.\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:\n```\nDefining the `minPath` function that takes a 2D list of integers `grid` and an integer `k` as input and returns a list of integers. The `grid` parameter is of type `List[List[int]]` and the return value is of type `List[int]`.\n\n```python\nn = len(grid)\n```\nGetting the length of the `grid` list and storing it in the variable `n`.\n\n```python\nval = n * n + 1\n```\nInitializing the variable `val` to `n * n + 1`. This is the maximum possible value of a cell in the `grid` list.\n\n```python\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if grid[i][j] == 1:\n            temp = []\n            if i != 0:\n                temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n\n            if j != 0:\n                temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n\n            if i != n - 1:\n                temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n\n            if j != n - 1:\n                temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n\n            val = min(temp)\n```\nIterating over each cell in the `grid` list. If the value of the cell is `1`, then the values of the adjacent cells are added to a temporary list `temp`. The minimum value in `temp` is then stored in the variable `val`.\n\n```python\nans = []\nfor i in range(k):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        ans.append(1)\n    else:\n        ans.append(val)\nreturn ans\n```\nInitializing an empty list `ans`. Then, iterating over the range `k`. If the index `i` is even, then `1` is appended to `ans`. Otherwise, the value of `val` is appended to `ans`. Finally, `ans` is returned.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (minPath grid k)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_89_encrypt", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (encrypt s)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_89_encrypt.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate encrypt))\n    (check-within (candidate \"hi\") \"lm\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"asdfghjkl\") \"ewhjklnop\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"gf\") \"kj\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"et\") \"ix\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"faewfawefaewg\") \"jeiajeaijeiak\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"hellomyfriend\") \"lippsqcjvmirh\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh\") \"hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl\" 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate \"a\") \"e\" 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and returns an encrypted string. \n\nThe first line of the function definition specifies the function signature. The function takes a string `s` as input and returns a string. The `->` symbol is used to specify the return type of the function.\n\nThe second line of the function creates a string `d` containing all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n\nThe third line of the function initializes an empty string `out` which will be used to store the encrypted string.\n\nThe fourth line of the function starts a loop that iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`.\n\nThe fifth line of the function checks if the current character `c` is a lowercase letter of the English alphabet. If it is, the next line is executed, otherwise the else block is executed.\n\nThe sixth line of the function finds the index of the current character `c` in the string `d`. It then adds 4 to this index (2*2) and takes the result modulo 26. This gives the index of the encrypted character in the string `d`. The encrypted character is then appended to the `out` string.\n\nThe seventh line of the function is executed if the current character `c` is not a lowercase letter of the English alphabet. In this case, the current character is simply appended to the `out` string.\n\nThe eighth line of the function returns the encrypted string.<|im_end|>\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (encrypt s)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_100_make_a_pile", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (make_a_pile n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_100_make_a_pile.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate make_a_pile))\n    (check-within (candidate 3) (list 3 5 7) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) (list 4 6 8 10) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) (list 5 7 9 11 13) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 6) (list 6 8 10 12 14 16) 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 8) (list 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22) 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The list comprehension iterates over `n` values of `i` and returns `n + 2*i` for each value of `i`. \n\nThe fourth line returns the list created in the third line.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (make_a_pile n)\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_31_is_prime", "language": "rkt", "prompt": "#lang racket\n\n(define (is_prime n)\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_31_is_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "(require rackunit)\n\n(define (test-humaneval) \n\n  (let (( candidate is_prime))\n    (check-within (candidate 6) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 101) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 13441) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 61) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 4) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 1) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 5) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 11) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 17) #t 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 85) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 77) #f 0.001)\n    (check-within (candidate 255379) #f 0.001)\n))\n\n(test-humaneval)", "stop_tokens": ["\n(define ", "\n#|", "\n;", "\n("], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If it is, the function returns `False` because 2 is the smallest prime number. \n\nThe second line of the function creates a `for` loop that iterates over a range of numbers from 2 to `n - 1`. The `range` function creates a sequence of numbers from the start value (2) to the end value (`n - 1`) with a step of 1. \n\nThe third line of the function checks if the input number `n` is divisible by the current number `k` in the `for` loop. If it is, the function returns `False` because `n` is not a prime number. \n\nThe last line of the function returns `True` if the input number `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers in the `for` loop. This means that `n` is a prime number.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (is_prime n)\n"}]
