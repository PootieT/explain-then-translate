The function checks if it is possible to move one ball from one position to another in the vector such that the vector becomes sorted in ascending order. If it is possible, the function returns true, otherwise false.\n\nThe function first checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, the function returns true. Otherwise, it creates a copy of the input vector called `sorted_array` and sorts it in ascending order using the `std::sort` function.\n\nNext, the function creates an empty vector called `my_arr`. It finds the minimum value in the input vector using the `std::min_element` function and stores it in a variable called `min_value`. It then finds the index of the minimum value in the input vector using the `std::find` function and stores it in a variable called `min_index`.\n\nThe function then inserts the elements of the input vector from the `min_index` position to the end of the vector into `my_arr` using the `insert` function. It then inserts the elements of the input vector from the beginning of the vector to the `min_index` position into `my_arr` using the `insert` function again.\n\nFinally, the function checks if `my_arr` is equal to `sorted_array`. If it is, the function returns true, otherwise false.\n\nNote that the code includes several header files, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. These header files are not used in the implementation of the `move_one_ball` function and can be removed. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef move_one_ball(arr: List[int]) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_131_digits", "language": "py", "prompt": "def digits(n: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_131_digits.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(5) == 5\n    assert candidate(54) == 5\n    assert candidate(120) == 1\n    assert candidate(5014) == 5\n    assert candidate(98765) == 315\n    assert candidate(5576543) == 2625\n    assert candidate(2468) == 0\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(digits)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function computes the product of all the odd digits of `n`. If `n` has no odd digits, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables: `product` and `odd_count`. `product` is set to 1 and `odd_count` is set to 0. \n\nThe function then iterates over each digit in `n` by converting `n` to a string using `std::to_string(n)` and iterating over each character in the resulting string using a range-based for loop. \n\nFor each digit, the function first converts it to an integer by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from the ASCII value of the digit. This is done using the expression `digit - '0'`. \n\nThe function then checks if the integer value of the digit is odd by checking if `int_digit % 2 == 1`. If the digit is odd, the function multiplies `product` by the integer value of the digit and increments `odd_count`. \n\nAfter iterating over all the digits in `n`, the function checks if `odd_count` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns `product`. \n\nThe function uses several C++ standard library headers including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, only `vector` is actually used in the implementation of the function. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a common programming problem.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. \n\nThe first line of the code includes the assert.h library, which is used for debugging purposes. The second line includes the bits/stdc++.h library, which is a header file that includes all standard libraries in C++. \n\nThe third line declares a vector of long integers called \"results\" and initializes it with the values 0, 0, 2, and 0. \n\nThe fourth line checks if the input value \"n\" is less than 4. If it is, the function returns the corresponding value in the \"results\" vector. \n\nThe fifth line starts a for loop that iterates from 4 to \"n\". \n\nThe sixth line calculates the next value in the sequence by adding the four previous values in the \"results\" vector. \n\nThe seventh line erases the first element in the \"results\" vector. \n\nThe eighth line adds the calculated value to the end of the \"results\" vector. \n\nThe ninth line returns the last value in the \"results\" vector, which is the nth value in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries to simplify the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Python.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\n#include<unordered_map>\n#include<unordered_set>\nstd::vector<long> order_by_points(std::vector<long> nums) {\n    auto digits_sum = [](long n) -> long {\n        long neg = 1;\n        if (n < 0) {\n            n = -1 * n;\n            neg = -1;\n        }\n        std::stringstream ss;\n        ss << n;\n        std::string s = ss.str();\n        std::vector<long> v;\n        for (auto c : s) {\n            v.push_back(c - '0');\n        }\n        v[0] = v[0] * neg;\n        return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0);\n    };\n    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [&](long a, long b) {\n        return digits_sum(a) < digits_sum(b);\n    });\n    return nums;\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function `order_by_points` that takes a vector of long integers and returns a new vector of long integers sorted by the sum of their digits. The function uses a lambda function `digits_sum` to calculate the sum of the digits of a long integer. \n\nThe `digits_sum` lambda function takes a long integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It first checks if the integer is negative and sets a flag `neg` accordingly. It then converts the integer to a string using a `stringstream` object and extracts each digit from the string by subtracting the ASCII value of `'0'` from the character. The first digit is then multiplied by the `neg` flag to account for negative numbers. Finally, the sum of the digits is calculated using the `std::accumulate` function.\n\nThe `order_by_points` function sorts the input vector `nums` using `std::sort` and a lambda function that compares the sum of the digits of two long integers. The lambda function calls `digits_sum` on each integer and returns `true` if the sum of the digits of the first integer is less than the sum of the digits of the second integer.\n\nThe function returns the sorted vector `nums`. \n\nTo rewrite the program in Python, we can use the following code:\n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef order_by_points(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_80_is_happy", "language": "py", "prompt": "def is_happy(s: str) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_80_is_happy.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('a') == False\n    assert candidate('aa') == False\n    assert candidate('abcd') == True\n    assert candidate('aabb') == False\n    assert candidate('adb') == True\n    assert candidate('xyy') == False\n    assert candidate('iopaxpoi') == True\n    assert candidate('iopaxioi') == False\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(is_happy)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks whether the input string is a \"happy\" string or not. A happy string is defined as a string that does not contain any consecutive characters that are the same, and also does not contain any of the substrings \"aaa\" or \"bbb\".\n\nThe function first checks if the length of the input string is less than 3. If it is, then the function returns false, since a happy string must have at least 3 characters.\n\nThe function then iterates over the input string, checking each group of 3 consecutive characters to see if they are all the same or if any two of them are the same. If either of these conditions is true, then the function returns false, since the input string contains consecutive characters that are the same.\n\nIf the function has iterated over the entire input string without finding any consecutive characters that are the same, it returns true, indicating that the input string is a happy string.\n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `is_happy` function, so they can be removed. \n\nHere is a Python implementation of the `is_happy` function:\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef is_happy(s: str) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_65_circular_shift", "language": "py", "prompt": "def circular_shift(x: int, shift: int) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_65_circular_shift.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(100, 2) == '001'\n    assert candidate(12, 2) == '12'\n    assert candidate(97, 8) == '79'\n    assert candidate(12, 1) == '21'\n    assert candidate(11, 101) == '11'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(circular_shift)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a string that is the result of circularly shifting the digits of `x` by `shift` positions to the left. \n\nThe function first converts the integer `x` to a string `s` using the `std::to_string` function. \n\nIf `shift` is greater than the length of `s`, the function returns the reverse of `s` using `std::string(s.rbegin(), s.rend())`. This is because a circular shift of `x` by `shift` positions is equivalent to a circular shift of `x` by `shift - s.size()` positions. For example, if `x` is `1234` and `shift` is `5`, then a circular shift of `x` by `5` positions is equivalent to a circular shift of `x` by `5 - 4 = 1` position, which is `2341`. However, if `shift` is greater than `s.size()`, then a circular shift of `x` by `shift - s.size()` positions is equivalent to a circular shift of `x` by `shift - s.size() - s.size()` positions, which is equivalent to a circular shift of `x` by `shift - s.size() - s.size() - ... - s.size()` positions, which is equivalent to a circular shift of `x` by `shift % s.size()` positions. Therefore, if `shift` is greater than `s.size()`, the function returns the reverse of `s`, which is equivalent to a circular shift of `x` by `s.size() - shift` positions.\n\nIf `shift` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, the function returns a substring of `s` that consists of the last `shift` characters of `s` followed by the first `s.size() - shift` characters of `s`. This is done using the `substr` function of `std::string`. \n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only the `string` header is actually used in the implementation of the `circular_shift` function. Therefore, the other headers are unnecessary and can be removed. \n\nThe code also uses the `long` data type for `x` and `shift`. In Python, the equivalent data type would be `int`. \n\nHere is the Python equivalent of the `circular_shift` function:\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef circular_shift(x: int, shift: int) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_115_max_fill", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef max_fill(grid: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_115_max_fill.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 1) == 6\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]], 2) == 5\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], 5) == 0\n    assert candidate([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 2) == 4\n    assert candidate([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 9) == 2\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(max_fill)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It returns a long integer. \n\nThe function is called `max_fill`.\n\nThe function calculates the maximum number of containers needed to hold the contents of the 2D vector, given that each container has a capacity of the long integer passed in as an argument.\n\nThe function does this by iterating through each row of the 2D vector and calculating the sum of the elements in each row. It then divides this sum by the capacity of the container and rounds up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function. This gives the number of containers needed to hold the contents of that row. The function then adds this number to a running total.\n\nFinally, the function returns the running total, which is the maximum number of containers needed to hold the contents of the entire 2D vector.\n\nThe function uses the following libraries: `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. \n\nThe `assert.h` library is used to check if a condition is true and terminate the program if it is not.\n\nThe `bits/stdc++.h` library is a shortcut to include all standard libraries in C++.\n\nThe `vector` library is used to define and manipulate vectors.\n\nThe `sstream` library is used to convert strings to numbers.\n\nThe `regex` library is used to perform regular expression matching.\n\nThe `map` library is used to define and manipulate maps.\n\nThe `set` library is used to define and manipulate sets. \n\nThe function takes in two arguments: a 2D vector of long integers called `grid` and a long integer called `capacity`.\n\nThe function defines a long integer called `sum` and initializes it to 0.\n\nThe function then iterates through each row of the 2D vector using a range-based for loop. For each row, it calculates the sum of the elements in the row using the `std::accumulate` function. This function takes in two iterators that define the range of elements to be summed and an initial value for the sum. In this case, the range of elements is defined by `arr.begin()` and `arr.end()`, which are iterators that point to the beginning and end of the current row. The initial value for the sum is 0.0, which is a floating-point number.\n\nThe function then divides the sum by the capacity of the container and rounds up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function. This gives the number of containers needed to hold the contents of that row. The function then adds this number to the running total `sum`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the running total `sum`, which is the maximum number of containers needed to hold the contents of the entire 2D vector.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_fill(grid: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_0_has_close_elements", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_0_has_close_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True\n    assert candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True\n    assert candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(has_close_elements)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is a header file that includes all the standard libraries in C++. \n\nThe third line declares a vector called `numbers` of type `float`. \n\nThe fourth line includes the `sstream` library, which provides a way to read and write strings as if they were streams. \n\nThe fifth line includes the `regex` library, which provides regular expression matching. \n\nThe sixth line includes the `map` library, which provides a way to store key-value pairs. \n\nThe seventh line includes the `set` library, which provides a way to store unique elements in a sorted order. \n\nThe function `has_close_elements` starts on the eighth line. It takes in two arguments: `numbers`, which is a vector of floats, and `threshold`, which is a float. \n\nThe first line of the function declares an integer variable `n` and sets it to the size of the `numbers` vector. \n\nThe function then enters a nested for loop that iterates over all pairs of elements in the `numbers` vector. The outer loop iterates over all elements in the vector, and the inner loop iterates over all elements in the vector again. \n\nThe if statement inside the inner loop checks if the current pair of elements being compared are not the same element (i.e., `i != j`). If they are not the same element, then the distance between the two elements is calculated using the `abs` function, which returns the absolute value of the difference between the two elements. \n\nIf the distance between the two elements is less than the threshold value, then the function returns `true`, indicating that there are two elements in the vector that are closer than the threshold value. \n\nIf the function has not returned `true` by the end of the nested for loop, then it returns `false`, indicating that there are no two elements in the vector that are closer than the threshold value. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_150_x_or_y", "language": "py", "prompt": "def x_or_y(n: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_150_x_or_y.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(7, 34, 12) == 34\n    assert candidate(15, 8, 5) == 5\n    assert candidate(3, 33, 5212) == 33\n    assert candidate(1259, 3, 52) == 3\n    assert candidate(7919, -1, 12) == -1\n    assert candidate(3609, 1245, 583) == 583\n    assert candidate(91, 56, 129) == 129\n    assert candidate(6, 34, 1234) == 1234\n    assert candidate(1, 2, 0) == 0\n    assert candidate(2, 2, 0) == 2\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(x_or_y)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the input string contains spaces or commas. If it contains spaces, it splits the string into words and returns a vector of strings. If it contains commas, it splits the string into words separated by commas and returns a vector of strings. If it contains neither spaces nor commas, it counts the number of lowercase characters in the string that have an even ASCII value and returns the count as a long integer.\n\nThe function uses a union data structure called `Union_std_vector_std_string__long` to store either a vector of strings or a long integer. The union has two fields: `f0` of type `std::vector<std::string>` and `f1` of type `long`. The constructor of the union takes either a vector of strings or a long integer and initializes the corresponding field. The union has two overloaded `operator==` functions that compare the union with either a vector of strings or a long integer.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the input string contains spaces or commas using the `find` function of the `std::string` class. If it contains spaces, it creates an empty vector of strings called `result`, creates a `std::stringstream` object called `ss` from the input string, and uses a `while` loop to extract each word from the `ss` object and push it into the `result` vector. Finally, it returns the `result` vector wrapped in the `Union_std_vector_std_string__long` union.\n\nIf the input string contains commas, the function does the same thing as above, but uses the `getline` function of the `std::stringstream` class to extract each word separated by commas.\n\nIf the input string contains neither spaces nor commas, the function initializes a long integer variable called `count` to zero and uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter and has an even ASCII value using the `islower` and `%` functions of the `ctype.h` library. If the character satisfies both conditions, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable wrapped in the `Union_std_vector_std_string__long` union.\n\nThe function includes several header files from the C++ standard library, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. The `assert.h` header file provides the `assert` function for debugging purposes. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes all the standard headers of the C++ library. The `vector`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set` header files provide container classes for storing data. The `sstream` header file provides the `std::stringstream` class for parsing strings. The `regex` header file provides regular expression support. The `ctype.h` library provides functions for character classification. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import Union, List\n\ndef split_words(txt: str) -> Union[List[str], int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_16_count_distinct_characters", "language": "py", "prompt": "def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_16_count_distinct_characters.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('') == 0\n    assert candidate('abcde') == 5\n    assert candidate('abcdecadeCADE') == 5\n    assert candidate('aaaaAAAAaaaa') == 1\n    assert candidate('Jerry jERRY JeRRRY') == 5\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(count_distinct_characters)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `fizz_buzz` takes in a long integer `n` and returns the number of times the digit `7` appears in the concatenation of all numbers between 0 and n that are divisible by 11 or 13.\n\nThe first line of the program includes the `assert.h` library which provides a macro `assert` that can be used to check if a condition is true. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library which includes all the standard libraries of C++. This is a shortcut to include all the libraries that may be needed in a program.

The fifth line includes the `regex` library which provides support for regular expressions. The sixth line includes the `map` library which provides an implementation of a dictionary in C++. The seventh line includes the `set` library which provides an implementation of a set in C++.\n\nThe function `fizz_buzz` starts by creating an empty vector `ns` to store all the numbers between 0 and n that are divisible by 11 or 13. It then iterates over all the numbers between 0 and n using a for loop. If a number is divisible by 11 or 13, it is added to the vector `ns`.\n\nThe function then creates an empty string stream `ss` to store the concatenation of all the numbers in `ns`. It then iterates over all the numbers in `ns` and appends them to the string stream `ss`.\n\nThe function then converts the string stream `ss` to a string `s`. It then initializes a variable `ans` to 0. It then iterates over all the characters in the string `s` and increments `ans` by 1 if the character is equal to the character `7`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_153_Strongest_Extension", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name: str, extensions: List[str]) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_153_Strongest_Extension.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe']) == 'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'\n    assert candidate('Boku123', ['nani', 'NazeDa', 'YEs.WeCaNe', '32145tggg']) == 'Boku123.YEs.WeCaNe'\n    assert candidate('__YESIMHERE', ['t', 'eMptY', 'nothing', 'zeR00', 'NuLl__', '123NoooneB321']) == '__YESIMHERE.NuLl__'\n    assert candidate('K', ['Ta', 'TAR', 't234An', 'cosSo']) == 'K.TAR'\n    assert candidate('__HAHA', ['Tab', '123', '781345', '-_-']) == '__HAHA.123'\n    assert candidate('YameRore', ['HhAas', 'okIWILL123', 'WorkOut', 'Fails', '-_-']) == 'YameRore.okIWILL123'\n    assert candidate('finNNalLLly', ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW']) == 'finNNalLLly.WoW'\n    assert candidate('_', ['Bb', '91245']) == '_.Bb'\n    assert candidate('Sp', ['671235', 'Bb']) == 'Sp.671235'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(Strongest_Extension)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a string that is the concatenation of the `class_name` and the string in `extensions` that has the most uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters. \n\nThe function first initializes a string called `strong` to the first element of the `extensions` vector. It then calculates the number of uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters in `strong` using the `count_if` function from the `algorithm` library. This value is stored in a variable called `my_val`. \n\nThe function then loops through each string `s` in the `extensions` vector. For each string, it calculates the number of uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters and stores this value in a variable called `val`. If `val` is greater than `my_val`, then `strong` is set to `s` and `my_val` is set to `val`. \n\nFinally, the function concatenates `class_name`, a period, and `strong` to form a new string called `ans`, which is returned by the function. \n\nThe following libraries are used in the program:\n- `assert.h`: Provides a macro called `assert` that can be used for debugging purposes. \n- `bits/stdc++.h`: A header file that includes all the standard library headers. \n- `vector`: A container that stores elements in contiguous memory. \n- `sstream`: Provides classes for string stream processing. \n- `regex`: Provides classes for regular expressions. \n- `map`: A container that stores key-value pairs. \n- `set`: A container that stores unique elements in sorted order. \n\nNote: The program assumes that the `extensions` vector is non-empty. If it is empty, the program will throw an error. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name: str, extensions: List[str]) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) == (3.9, 4.0)\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0]) == (5.0, 5.9)\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) == (2.0, 2.2)\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]) == (2.0, 2.0)\n    assert candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]) == (2.2, 3.1)\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(find_closest_elements)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The ninth line includes the `unordered_set` library which provides a container that stores unique elements in an unordered way.\n\nThe `find_closest_elements` function starts by initializing a tuple called `closest_pair` to hold the closest pair of elements and a float called `distance` to hold the distance between the closest pair. The function then loops through all possible pairs of elements in the vector using two nested for loops. For each pair of elements, the function calculates the distance between them using the `abs` function and stores it in a float called `new_distance`. If the distance between the current pair of elements is smaller than the current smallest distance, the function updates the `closest_pair` tuple and the `distance` float to hold the new closest pair of elements and the new smallest distance, respectively. Finally, the function returns the `closest_pair` tuple. \n\nThe function can be rewritten in Python as follows:\n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_124_valid_date", "language": "py", "prompt": "def valid_date(date: str) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_124_valid_date.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('03-11-2000') == True\n    assert candidate('15-01-2012') == False\n    assert candidate('04-0-2040') == False\n    assert candidate('06-04-2020') == True\n    assert candidate('01-01-2007') == True\n    assert candidate('03-32-2011') == False\n    assert candidate('') == False\n    assert candidate('04-31-3000') == False\n    assert candidate('06-06-2005') == True\n    assert candidate('21-31-2000') == False\n    assert candidate('04-12-2003') == True\n    assert candidate('04122003') == False\n    assert candidate('20030412') == False\n    assert candidate('2003-04') == False\n    assert candidate('2003-04-12') == False\n    assert candidate('04-2003') == False\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(valid_date)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the input string does not contain a space character, the entire input string is used as the date.\n\nThe function then uses the `sscanf` function to parse the date string into three integers representing the month, day, and year. If the parsing fails, the function returns false.\n\nThe function then checks if the month is between 1 and 12. If not, the function returns false.\n\nThe function then checks if the day is valid for the given month. If the month is January, March, May, July, August, October, or December, the day must be between 1 and 31. If the month is April, June, September, or November, the day must be between 1 and 30. If the month is February, the day must be between 1 and 29 if the year is a leap year, and between 1 and 28 otherwise.\n\nIf any of the checks fail, the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.\n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, none of these headers are actually used in the implementation of the `valid_date` function, so they can be removed.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the same function:\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef valid_date(date: str) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_53_add", "language": "py", "prompt": "def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_53_add.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(0, 1) == 1\n    assert candidate(1, 0) == 1\n    assert candidate(2, 3) == 5\n    assert candidate(5, 7) == 12\n    assert candidate(7, 5) == 12\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(add)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `assert.h` library is used to include the assert function, which is used to verify that a certain condition is true. The `bits/stdc++.h` library is a header file that includes all the standard libraries in C++. The `vector` library is used to create a dynamic array of strings. The `sstream` library is used to convert strings to other data types. The `regex` library is used to work with regular expressions. The `map` library is used to create a mapping between keys and values. The `set` library is used to create a set of unique elements.\n\nThe function then creates a `map` called `value_map` that maps the English words for numbers to their corresponding integer values. \n\nThe function then creates an empty `vector` called `nums` that will be used to store the individual numbers in the input string. \n\nThe function then creates a `stringstream` called `ss` that is used to read the input string. \n\nThe function then creates a string called `num` that will be used to store each individual number as it is read from the input string. \n\nThe function then enters a `while` loop that reads each individual number from the input string and adds it to the `nums` vector. \n\nThe function then sorts the `nums` vector in ascending order using the `sort` function and a lambda function that uses the `value_map` to compare the values of the individual numbers. \n\nThe function then creates an empty string called `res` that will be used to store the sorted numbers as a string. \n\nThe function then enters a `for` loop that iterates over each number in the `nums` vector and adds it to the `res` string, followed by a space. \n\nThe function then removes the last space from the `res` string using the `pop_back` function. \n\nThe function then returns the `res` string. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_73_smallest_change", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef smallest_change(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_73_smallest_change.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]) == 4\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n    assert candidate([1, 4, 2]) == 1\n    assert candidate([1, 4, 4, 2]) == 1\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    assert candidate([3, 1, 1, 3]) == 0\n    assert candidate([1]) == 0\n    assert candidate([0, 1]) == 1\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(smallest_change)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The first line of the function checks if the input vector is empty. If it is empty, the function returns an empty optional. The second line of the function initializes a variable prod to 0. The third line of the function counts the number of negative integers in the input vector arr using the count_if function from the algorithm library. The count_if function takes in two arguments: the first argument is the beginning of the range to be counted, and the second argument is the end of the range to be counted. The third argument is a lambda function that takes in a long x and returns true if x is less than 0, and false otherwise. The lambda function is used to count the number of negative integers in the input vector arr. The fourth line of the function checks if the input vector arr contains the integer 0 using the find function from the algorithm library. The find function takes in two arguments: the first argument is the beginning of the range to be searched, and the second argument is the end of the range to be searched. The find function returns an iterator to the first occurrence of the integer 0 in the input vector arr, or the end iterator if the integer 0 is not found. If the integer 0 is found in the input vector arr, the variable prod is set to 0. Otherwise, the variable prod is set to pow(-1, neg_count), which is the product of -1 raised to the power of the number of negative integers in the input vector arr. The pow function is used to raise -1 to the power of neg_count. The pow function takes in two arguments: the first argument is the base, and the second argument is the exponent. The pow function returns the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent. The fifth line of the function initializes a variable sum to 0. The sixth line of the function iterates over the input vector arr using a range-based for loop. The range-based for loop iterates over each element i in the input vector arr. The seventh line of the function adds the absolute value of i to the variable sum using the abs function from the cmath library. The abs function takes in one argument, which is the value whose absolute value is to be calculated. The abs function returns the absolute value of the input value. The eighth line of the function returns the product of the variable prod and the variable sum as an optional long.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\ndef prod_signs(arr: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_49_modp", "language": "py", "prompt": "def modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_49_modp.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(3, 5) == 3\n    assert candidate(1101, 101) == 2\n    assert candidate(0, 101) == 1\n    assert candidate(3, 11) == 8\n    assert candidate(100, 101) == 1\n    assert candidate(30, 5) == 4\n    assert candidate(31, 5) == 3\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(modp)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `abs` function is used to ensure that negative numbers are treated as positive numbers. The `%` operator is used to get the remainder of the number when divided by 10, which gives the last digit of the number. The `*` operator is used to multiply the two last digits together. \n\nThe function does not have any side effects and does not modify any global variables.

It then iterates through each element `i` in the input vector `x`. \n\nFor each element `i`, it sets a boolean variable `is_odd` to `true`. It then iterates through each character `c` in the string representation of `i` using `std::to_string(i)`. \n\nFor each character `c`, it checks if it is an odd digit by checking if `c % 2 == 0`. If it is even, it sets `is_odd` to `false` and breaks out of the loop. If it is odd, it continues to the next character. \n\nAfter iterating through all the characters in `i`, if `is_odd` is still `true`, it means that all the digits in `i` are odd. In this case, it appends `i` to the `odd_digit_elements` vector. \n\nFinally, it sorts the `odd_digit_elements` vector in ascending order using `std::sort` and returns it. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef unique_digits(x: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_72_will_it_fly", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef will_it_fly(q: List[int], w: int) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_72_will_it_fly.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([3, 2, 3], 9) == True\n    assert candidate([1, 2], 5) == False\n    assert candidate([3], 5) == True\n    assert candidate([3, 2, 3], 1) == False\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3], 6) == False\n    assert candidate([5], 5) == True\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(will_it_fly)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a boolean value of `true` or `false`. \n\nThe function first checks if the sum of all the elements in the vector `q` is greater than `w`. If it is, the function returns `false`. \n\nIf the sum of all the elements in the vector `q` is less than or equal to `w`, the function checks if the vector `q` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. In this case, a vector is a palindrome if the first element is equal to the last element, the second element is equal to the second-to-last element, and so on. \n\nThe function checks if the vector `q` is a palindrome by iterating through the vector from both ends simultaneously. If the elements at the current positions are not equal, the function returns `false`. If all the elements are equal, the function returns `true`. \n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only the `vector` library is actually used in the code. \n\nThe `assert.h` library is used for debugging purposes and is not necessary for the function to run. The `bits/stdc++.h` library is a shortcut for including all the standard libraries in C++. The `sstream` library is used for string manipulation, but is not used in this code. The `regex` library is used for regular expressions, but is not used in this code. The `map` and `set` libraries are used for storing key-value pairs and sets, respectively, but are not used in this code. \n\nThe function `std::accumulate` is used to calculate the sum of all the elements in the vector `q`. The function `std::accumulate` takes three arguments: the beginning of the range, the end of the range, and the initial value of the sum. In this case, the beginning of the range is `q.begin()`, the end of the range is `q.end()`, and the initial value of the sum is `0`. \n\nThe function `q.size()` returns the number of elements in the vector `q`. The variable `i` is initialized to `0`, and the variable `j` is initialized to `q.size()-1`. The `while` loop continues as long as `i<j`. \n\nInside the `while` loop, the function checks if the element at position `i` in the vector `q` is equal to the element at position `j` in the vector `q`. If they are not equal, the function returns `false`. If they are equal, the loop continues and `i` is incremented by `1`, while `j` is decremented by `1`. \n\nIf the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef will_it_fly(q: List[int], w: int) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_75_is_multiply_prime", "language": "py", "prompt": "def is_multiply_prime(a: int) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_75_is_multiply_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(5) == False\n    assert candidate(30) == True\n    assert candidate(8) == True\n    assert candidate(10) == False\n    assert candidate(125) == True\n    assert candidate(105) == True\n    assert candidate(126) == False\n    assert candidate(729) == False\n    assert candidate(891) == False\n    assert candidate(1001) == True\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(is_multiply_prime)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks if the input integer is a product of three prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive). \n\nThe function starts by defining a lambda function called `is_prime` that takes in a long integer `n` and returns a boolean value. The lambda function checks if the input integer is prime by iterating from 2 to `n-1` and checking if any of the numbers in that range divide `n` without a remainder. If any of the numbers divide `n` without a remainder, then the lambda function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.\n\nThe function then iterates through all possible combinations of three prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive) using three nested for-loops. If the product of the three prime numbers is equal to the input integer `a`, then the function returns `true`. If no combination of three prime numbers results in the input integer `a`, then the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `is_multiply_prime` function. Therefore, they can be removed from the code without affecting the functionality of the function. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef is_multiply_prime(a: int) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_120_maximum", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef maximum(arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_120_maximum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([-3, -4, 5], 3) == [-4, -3, 5]\n    assert candidate([4, -4, 4], 2) == [4, 4]\n    assert candidate([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1) == [2]\n    assert candidate([123, -123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3], 3) == [2, 20, 123]\n    assert candidate([-123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3], 4) == [0, 1, 2, 20]\n    assert candidate([5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0], 7) == [-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15]\n    assert candidate([-1, 0, 2, 5, 3, -10], 2) == [3, 5]\n    assert candidate([1, 0, 5, -7], 1) == [5]\n    assert candidate([4, -4], 2) == [-4, 4]\n    assert candidate([-10, 10], 2) == [-10, 10]\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, -23, 243, -400, 0], 0) == []\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(maximum)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The lambda function checks whether the input number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is, the function returns false, otherwise it returns true.\n\nThe next line initializes a variable `maxx` to 0. This variable will be used to store the largest prime number in the vector.\n\nThe next line is a for loop that iterates over each element `i` in the input vector `lst`. If `i` is greater than `maxx` and is a prime number (as determined by the `isPrime` lambda function), then `maxx` is set to `i`.\n\nThe next line initializes a variable `result` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of the digits of the largest prime number.\n\nThe next line converts the largest prime number `maxx` to a string using the `std::to_string` function.\n\nThe next line is a for loop that iterates over each character `c` in the string representation of `maxx`. The loop adds the integer value of each character to `result` by subtracting the ASCII value of the character '0' from the ASCII value of the character `c`.\n\nThe final line of the function returns the value of `result`.\n\nThe code includes several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, not all of these headers are actually used in the code, so some of them could be removed. \n\nThe `assert.h` header is not used in the code and can be removed.\n\nThe `bits/stdc++.h` header is a non-standard header that includes all other standard headers. While it can be convenient to use, it is not portable and should be avoided in production code.\n\nThe `vector`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set` headers are used to define the standard library containers used in the code.\n\nThe `sstream` header is not used in the code and can be removed.\n\nThe `regex` header is not used in the code and can be removed.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef skjkasdkd(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_74_total_match", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef total_match(lst1: List[str], lst2: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_74_total_match.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([], []) == []\n    assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi']) == ['hi', 'hi']\n    assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) == ['hi', 'admin']\n    assert candidate(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) == ['4']\n    assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) == ['hI', 'Hi']\n    assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) == ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']\n    assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']\n    assert candidate([], ['this']) == []\n    assert candidate(['this'], []) == []\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(total_match)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

A simple power is defined as `n^k` where `k` is a positive integer. \n\nThe function takes two arguments, `x` and `n`. \n\nThe function returns a boolean value, `true` if `x` is a simple power of `n` and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to `1`. If `n` is equal to `1`, then the function returns `true` if `x` is also equal to `1`. This is because `1^k` is always equal to `1` for any positive integer `k`.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to `1`, the function initializes a variable `power` to `1`. The function then enters a while loop that continues to run as long as `power` is less than `x`. \n\nIn each iteration of the while loop, `power` is multiplied by `n`. The while loop continues to run until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`.\n\nIf `power` is equal to `x`, then `x` is a simple power of `n` and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function makes use of the following C++ libraries:\n\n- `assert.h`: This library provides a macro `assert` that can be used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the program terminates with an error message.\n\n- `bits/stdc++.h`: This library includes all the standard C++ libraries. It is not recommended to use this library in production code as it can slow down compilation times.\n\n- `vector`: This library provides a container class `vector` that can be used to store a dynamic array of elements.\n\n- `sstream`: This library provides a class `stringstream` that can be used to convert strings to other data types.\n\n- `regex`: This library provides support for regular expressions.\n\n- `map`: This library provides a container class `map` that can be used to store key-value pairs.\n\n- `set`: This library provides a container class `set` that can be used to store a set of elements. \n\nThe function does not make use of any of these libraries. \n\nThe function uses a `long` data type to store the values of `x` and `n`. In Python, the equivalent data type would be `int`. \n\nThe function could be rewritten in Python as follows:\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef is_simple_power(x: int, n: int) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_93_encode", "language": "py", "prompt": "def encode(message: str) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_93_encode.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('TEST') == 'tgst'\n    assert candidate('Mudasir') == 'mWDCSKR'\n    assert candidate('YES') == 'ygs'\n    assert candidate('This is a message') == 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n    assert candidate('I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE') == 'k dQnT kNqW wHcT Tq wRkTg'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(encode)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Python.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\nlong vowels_count(std::string s) {\n    std::string vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\";\n    long n_vowels = std::count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char c){return vowels.find(c) != std::string::npos;});\n    if (s.back() == 'y' || s.back() == 'Y') {\n        n_vowels += 1;\n    }\n    return n_vowels;\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function that counts the number of vowels in a string. \n\nThe first line includes the assert.h library which provides a macro for debugging purposes. The second line includes the bits/stdc++.h library which is a header file that includes all standard libraries. The third line includes the vector library which provides a container that can hold a dynamic array of elements. The fourth line includes the sstream library which provides a stream class to operate on strings. The fifth line includes the regex library which provides regular expression support. The sixth line includes the map library which provides an associative container that stores elements in key-value pairs. The seventh line includes the set library which provides a container that stores unique elements in a sorted order.\n\nThe function takes a string as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the string. The function first initializes a string variable called vowels with all the vowels in the English language. It then initializes a long variable called n_vowels to the number of vowels in the string s. The count_if function is used to count the number of vowels in the string. The lambda function passed to the count_if function checks if the character is a vowel by checking if it is present in the vowels string. \n\nThe function then checks if the last character of the string is 'y' or 'Y'. If it is, it increments the n_vowels variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the n_vowels variable which contains the number of vowels in the string. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef vowels_count(s: str) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_149_sorted_list_sum", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_149_sorted_list_sum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(['aa', 'a', 'aaa']) == ['aa']\n    assert candidate(['school', 'AI', 'asdf', 'b']) == ['AI', 'asdf', 'school']\n    assert candidate(['d', 'b', 'c', 'a']) == []\n    assert candidate(['d', 'dcba', 'abcd', 'a']) == ['abcd', 'dcba']\n    assert candidate(['AI', 'ai', 'au']) == ['AI', 'ai', 'au']\n    assert candidate(['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'a']) == []\n    assert candidate(['aaaa', 'bbbb', 'dd', 'cc']) == ['cc', 'dd', 'aaaa', 'bbbb']\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(sorted_list_sum)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `sorted_list_sum` and takes a single argument, `lst`, which is a vector of strings.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the header file `assert.h`, which contains the `assert` function that is used to test for logical errors in the code. The second line includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which is a shortcut for including all the standard C++ header files. This is not a recommended practice in production code, but is often used in competitive programming to save time.\n\nThe third line declares a vector of strings called `lst`. The fourth line declares a stringstream object called `ss`. The fifth line declares a regular expression object called `re`. The sixth line declares a map object called `mp`. The seventh line declares a set object called `st`.\n\nThe `sorted_list_sum` function begins by sorting the input list of strings in ascending order using the `std::sort` function. The `std::sort` function takes two arguments: the beginning and end of the range to be sorted. In this case, the range is the entire `lst` vector.\n\nThe function then creates a new vector of strings called `new_lst`. It iterates over the sorted input list using a range-based for loop. For each string `i` in the input list, it checks if the length of the string is even using the `%` operator. If the length is even, the string is added to the `new_lst` vector using the `push_back` function.\n\nThe `new_lst` vector is then sorted in ascending order of string length using a lambda function that takes two strings `a` and `b` as arguments and returns `true` if `a` has a smaller length than `b`. The `std::sort` function is used again to sort the `new_lst` vector.\n\nFinally, the `new_lst` vector is returned as the output of the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_101_words_string", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef words_string(s: str) -> List[str]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_101_words_string.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('Hi, my name is John') == ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']\n    assert candidate('One, two, three, four, five, six') == ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']\n    assert candidate('Hi, my name') == ['Hi', 'my', 'name']\n    assert candidate('One,, two, three, four, five, six,') == ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']\n    assert candidate('') == []\n    assert candidate('ahmed     , gamal') == ['ahmed', 'gamal']\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(words_string)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The lambda function converts the integer to a string and checks if the string is equal to its reverse.\n\nThe function then initializes two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to 0. It then loops through all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if each integer is a palindrome and whether it is even or odd. If the integer is odd and a palindrome, `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented. If the integer is even and a palindrome, `even_palindrome_count` is incremented.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_71_triangle_area", "language": "py", "prompt": "def triangle_area(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_71_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(3, 4, 5) == 6.0\n    assert candidate(1, 2, 10) == -1\n    assert candidate(4, 8, 5) == 8.18\n    assert candidate(2, 2, 2) == 1.73\n    assert candidate(1, 2, 3) == -1\n    assert candidate(10, 5, 7) == 16.25\n    assert candidate(2, 6, 3) == -1\n    assert candidate(1, 1, 1) == 0.43\n    assert candidate(2, 2, 10) == -1\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(triangle_area)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This variable will be used to keep track of the state of the keys in the dictionary. \n\nThe function then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary using a range-based for loop. \n\nFor each key, it first checks if all the characters in the key are alphabets using the `std::all_of` function. If not, it sets the `state` variable to \"mixed\" and breaks out of the loop. \n\nIf the key is alphabetic, the function checks the state of the keys seen so far. If `state` is \"start\", it checks if all the characters in the key are upper case or lower case. If all characters are upper case, it sets `state` to \"upper\". If all characters are lower case, it sets `state` to \"lower\". If the characters are neither all upper case nor all lower case, it breaks out of the loop. \n\nIf `state` is not \"start\", the function checks if the current key is consistent with the state. If the state is \"upper\" and the current key contains any lower case characters, or if the state is \"lower\" and the current key contains any upper case characters, it sets `state` to \"mixed\" and breaks out of the loop. \n\nFinally, the function returns true if `state` is \"upper\" or \"lower\", and false otherwise. \n\nThe function makes use of several C++ standard library functions and data structures. These include `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, not all of these are actually used in the function, and some may be included unnecessarily. \n\nThe function signature specifies that it returns a boolean value and takes in a single argument, which is a `std::map` object with keys and values of type `std::string`. \n\nOverall, the function is a relatively simple implementation of a dictionary key case checker. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import Dict\n\ndef check_dict_case(dict: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_130_tri", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef tri(n: int) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_130_tri.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(3) == [1, 3, 2, 8]\n    assert candidate(4) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3]\n    assert candidate(5) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15]\n    assert candidate(6) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4]\n    assert candidate(7) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24]\n    assert candidate(8) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24, 5]\n    assert candidate(9) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24, 5, 35]\n    assert candidate(20) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 15, 4, 24, 5, 35, 6, 48, 7, 63, 8, 80, 9, 99, 10, 120, 11]\n    assert candidate(0) == [1]\n    assert candidate(1) == [1, 3]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(tri)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the vector is empty, the function returns an empty optional. \n\nThe first line includes the `assert.h` header file which provides a macro called `assert` that can be used to check for runtime errors. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file which is a shortcut to include all standard C++ headers. This is not a standard header file and is not recommended for use in production code. \n\nThe next few lines include various standard C++ headers such as `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. These headers provide various data structures and algorithms that are used in the implementation of the `longest` function. \n\nThe `longest` function takes in a vector of strings called `strings`. The first line of the function checks if the vector is empty using the `empty` method of the vector. If the vector is empty, the function returns an empty optional using the `nullopt` constant provided by the `optional` header. \n\nThe next line of the function uses the `max_element` algorithm provided by the `algorithm` header to find the longest string in the vector. The `max_element` algorithm takes in two iterators that define the range of elements to search and a comparison function that is used to compare the elements. In this case, the comparison function is a lambda function that takes in two strings and returns true if the first string is shorter than the second string. The `max_element` algorithm returns an iterator to the longest string in the vector. \n\nThe last line of the function returns the longest string in the vector by dereferencing the iterator returned by the `max_element` algorithm. The dereferencing operator `*` is used to get the value pointed to by the iterator. The value is returned as an optional string using the `optional` header. \n\nOverall, the `longest` function is a simple implementation of finding the longest string in a vector of strings. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\ndef longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_58_common", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef common(l1: List[int], l2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_58_common.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]) == [1, 5, 653]\n    assert candidate([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]) == [2, 3]\n    assert candidate([4, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2, 4]) == [2, 3, 4]\n    assert candidate([4, 3, 2, 8], []) == []\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(common)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If it is, the function returns an empty vector. \n\nIf the input vector is not empty, the function proceeds to sort it. \n\nThe second line of the function checks whether the sum of the first and last elements of the input vector is even. If it is, the boolean variable `isReversed` is set to `true`, otherwise it is set to `false`. \n\nThe third line of the function sorts the input vector using the `std::sort` function. The sorting order is determined by a lambda function that takes two long integers as input and returns a boolean value. If `isReversed` is `true`, the lambda function returns `true` if the first input is greater than the second input, otherwise it returns `false`. If `isReversed` is `false`, the lambda function returns `true` if the first input is less than the second input, otherwise it returns `false`. \n\nThe fourth line of the function returns the sorted vector. \n\nThe code includes several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe program defines a function `get_odd_collatz` that takes a long integer `n` as input and returns a vector of long integers. The function returns the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence starting from `n` and ending at 1. \n\nThe function first initializes an empty vector `odd_collatz`. If `n` is even, the function returns an empty vector. If `n` is odd, the function adds `n` to the vector `odd_collatz`.\n\nThe function then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. Inside the while loop, if `n` is even, the function divides `n` by 2. If `n` is odd, the function multiplies `n` by 3 and adds 1. If `n` is odd, the function adds `n` to the vector `odd_collatz`.\n\nFinally, the function sorts the vector `odd_collatz` in ascending order and returns it. \n\nThe program includes several header files: `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. The header files `vector`, `map`, and `set` are used to define the vector and map data structures. The header file `sstream` is used to convert strings to numbers.

If it is, then the function returns the ceiling of the double precision number if it is positive, and the floor of the number if it is negative. If the last digit of the original string is not a '5', then the function returns the rounded value of the double precision number. \n\nThe function returns a long integer. \n\nThe code also includes a number of C++ standard library headers that are used in the implementation of the function. These headers include `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`.

The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library which is a header file that includes all the standard libraries in C++. This is a non-standard library and is not recommended for use in production code. \n\nThe third line includes the `vector` library which is used to create a dynamic array. The fourth line includes the `sstream` library which is used for string manipulation. The fifth line includes the `regex` library which is used for regular expressions. The sixth line includes the `map` library which is used to create a key-value pair data structure. The seventh line includes the `set` library which is used to create a set data structure.\n\nThe `prime_fib` function takes in a single argument `n` which is of type `long`. The function returns a `long` value which is the nth prime Fibonacci number. \n\nThe `is_prime` lambda function is defined inside the `prime_fib` function. The lambda function takes in a single argument `p` which is of type `long`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether `p` is a prime number or not. \n\nThe `std::vector<long> f = {0, 1};` line creates a vector `f` of type `long` and initializes it with the values 0 and 1. \n\nThe `while (true)` loop runs indefinitely until the `return` statement is executed. \n\nThe `f.push_back(f.back() + f[f.size() - 2]);` line appends the sum of the last two elements of the vector `f` to the end of the vector. \n\nThe `if (is_prime(f.back())) { n -= 1; }` line checks if the last element of the vector `f` is a prime number. If it is, then `n` is decremented by 1. \n\nThe `if (n == 0) { return f.back(); }` line checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, then the last element of the vector `f` is returned. \n\nIn summary, the `prime_fib` function generates the Fibonacci sequence and checks if each number is a prime number. If it is, then it decrements `n` by 1. Once `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the last element of the Fibonacci sequence that is a prime number. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef prime_fib(n: int) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_8_sum_product", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_8_sum_product.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([]) == (0, 1)\n    assert candidate([1, 1, 1]) == (3, 1)\n    assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)\n    assert candidate([3, 5, 7]) == (15, 105)\n    assert candidate([10]) == (10, 10)\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(sum_product)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a vector of strings that contains all the words in the input string that have exactly `n` consonants. \n\nThe function first creates an empty vector of strings called `result`. It then creates a `stringstream` object `ss` from the input string `s`. The `stringstream` object is used to split the input string into individual words. \n\nThe function then enters a while loop that reads each word from the `stringstream` object `ss`. For each word, it counts the number of consonants in the word by iterating over each character in the word and checking if it is a consonant. If the number of consonants in the word is equal to `n`, the word is added to the `result` vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector containing all the words that have exactly `n` consonants.\n\nThe function uses several C++ standard library classes and functions to achieve its goal. These include:\n\n- `std::vector`: A container class that stores a dynamic array of elements.\n- `std::stringstream`: A class that allows for string streams, which can be used to read and write to strings as if they were input/output streams.\n- `std::string`: A class that represents a sequence of characters.\n- `std::string::npos`: A static member constant of the `std::string` class that represents the maximum value for the size_t type.

If the vector has less than two elements, the function returns `std::nullopt`.\n\nThe function first sorts the vector in ascending order using `std::sort(lst.begin(), lst.end())`. It then removes any duplicates using `lst.erase(std::unique(lst.begin(), lst.end()), lst.end())`. \n\nFinally, the function checks if the size of the vector is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `std::nullopt`. Otherwise, it returns the second element of the vector using `std::make_optional(lst[1])`. \n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only `vector` is actually used in the code. The other headers are likely included for convenience or future use. \n\nNote that `std::optional` is a C++17 feature that allows functions to return an optional value, which can either be a value or `std::nullopt`. This is used in the function to indicate that there may not be a second smallest element in the vector. \n\nOverall, the code is relatively simple and straightforward. It sorts the vector, removes duplicates, and returns the second smallest element if it exists. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\ndef next_smallest(lst: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_87_get_row", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef get_row(lst: List[List[int]], x: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_87_get_row.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]], 2) == [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 2), (3, 0), (4, 3), (4, 0), (5, 4), (5, 0), (6, 5), (6, 0)]\n    assert candidate([], 1) == []\n    assert candidate([[1]], 2) == []\n    assert candidate([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(get_row)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The tuples contain the row and column indices of the occurrences.\n\nThe function first initializes an empty vector of tuples called `coords`. It then loops through all the rows and columns of `lst` and checks if the current element is equal to `x`. If it is, it creates a tuple containing the row and column indices of the element and appends it to `coords`.\n\nAfter all occurrences of `x` have been found, the function sorts the tuples in `coords` first by row index in ascending order and then by column index in descending order. This means that occurrences in the same row are sorted by column index in descending order. The sorting is done using a lambda function that takes two tuples as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the first tuple should come before the second tuple in the sorted vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sorted vector of tuples containing the coordinates of all occurrences of `x` in `lst`. \n\nThe function uses several C++ standard library headers including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, only `vector` is actually used in the implementation of the function. The other headers are unnecessary and can be removed. \n\nTo rewrite the program in Python, we can use a list of lists instead of a 2D vector and a list of tuples instead of a vector of tuples. We can also use the built-in `sorted` function instead of `std::sort`.

The function returns a new vector of strings that have the prefix string as a prefix. \n\nThe first line `#include<assert.h>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `assert.h` header file. The `assert.h` header file provides a macro called `assert` which is used to verify assumptions made by the program and print an error message if the assumption is false.\n\nThe second line `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file. This header file includes all the standard C++ library headers.\n\nThe third line `#include<vector>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `vector` header file. The `vector` header file provides the `std::vector` class which is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.\n\nThe fourth line `#include<sstream>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `sstream` header file. The `sstream` header file provides the `std::stringstream` class which is used to convert strings to other data types.\n\nThe fifth line `#include<regex>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `regex` header file. The `regex` header file provides support for regular expressions.\n\nThe sixth line `#include<map>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `map` header file. The `map` header file provides the `std::map` class which is an associative container that stores key-value pairs.\n\nThe seventh line `#include<set>` is a preprocessor directive that includes the `set` header file. The `set` header file provides the `std::set` class which is an associative container that stores unique elements in sorted order.\n\nThe function `filter_by_prefix` takes in two arguments, a vector of strings `strings` and a string `prefix`. \n\nThe first line of the function `std::vector<std::string> res;` declares a new vector of strings called `res`.\n\nThe second line of the function `for (auto x: strings) {` is a for loop that iterates over each element `x` in the `strings` vector.\n\nThe third line of the function `if (x.find(prefix) == 0) {` checks if the string `x` starts with the prefix string. The `find` method of the string class returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or `std::string::npos` if the substring is not found. If the index is 0, then the substring is found at the beginning of the string.\n\nThe fourth line of the function `res.push_back(x);` adds the string `x` to the `res` vector if it starts with the prefix string.\n\nThe fifth line of the function `}` closes the if statement.\n\nThe sixth line of the function `}` closes the for loop.\n\nThe seventh line of the function `return res;` returns the new vector of strings that have the prefix string as a prefix.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_102_choose_num", "language": "py", "prompt": "def choose_num(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_102_choose_num.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(12, 15) == 14\n    assert candidate(13, 12) == -1\n    assert candidate(33, 12354) == 12354\n    assert candidate(5234, 5233) == -1\n    assert candidate(6, 29) == 28\n    assert candidate(27, 10) == -1\n    assert candidate(7, 7) == -1\n    assert candidate(546, 546) == 546\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(choose_num)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is defined in the global scope of the program.\n\nThe function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, the function returns -1. This is because the function is supposed to return a number between `x` and `y`, and if `x` is greater than `y`, there is no such number.\n\nIf `x` is not greater than `y`, the function checks if `y` is even. If it is, the function returns `y`. This is because if `y` is even, then `y` is the largest even number between `x` and `y`, and the function is supposed to return the largest even number between `x` and `y`.\n\nIf `y` is not even, the function checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If it is, the function returns -1. This is because there is no even number between `x` and `y` if `y` is odd and `x` is equal to `y`.\n\nIf `x` is not equal to `y`, the function returns `y - 1`. This is because `y - 1` is the largest even number between `x` and `y` if `y` is odd and `x` is not equal to `y`. \n\nThe program includes several header files at the beginning of the program. These header files are used to include libraries of pre-written code that can be used in the program.

If the length of the string is not divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the string - 1, the function returns true. \n\nOverall, the function checks if the length of the string is a prime number or not and returns a boolean value. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef prime_length(string: str) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_60_sum_to_n", "language": "py", "prompt": "def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_60_sum_to_n.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(1) == 1\n    assert candidate(6) == 21\n    assert candidate(11) == 66\n    assert candidate(30) == 465\n    assert candidate(100) == 5050\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(sum_to_n)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function removes all words in the sentence that are either of length 1 or have a length that is a multiple of any number greater than 1.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` library which is used to include the `assert` function. The `assert` function is used to check if a condition is true and if it is not, the program will terminate.\n\nThe second line of the code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library which is a header file that includes all other header files in the standard library. This is done so that the programmer does not have to include all the necessary header files individually.\n\nThe third line of the code includes the `vector` library which is used to create a dynamic array of elements of the same data type. The fourth line of the code includes the `stringstream` library which is used to read and write from strings as if they were input/output streams. The fifth line of the code includes the `string` library which is used to manipulate strings. The sixth line of the code includes the `regex` library which is used to perform regular expression matching and replacement. The seventh line of the code includes the `map` library which is used to create a collection of key-value pairs. The eighth line of the code includes the `set` library which is used to create a collection of unique elements.\n\nThe ninth line of the code defines the function `words_in_sentence` which takes in a string called `sentence` and returns a string. The function is of type `std::string` which means that it returns a string.\n\nThe tenth line of the code creates a vector called `new_lst` which is used to store the words in the sentence that are not of length 1 or have a length that is a multiple of any number greater than 1.\n\nThe eleventh line of the code creates a stringstream object called `ss` which is used to read from the `sentence` string.\n\nThe twelfth line of the code creates a string called `word` which is used to store each word in the sentence.\n\nThe thirteenth line of the code creates a while loop that reads each word from the `ss` stringstream object and stores it in the `word` string. The loop continues until there are no more words to read.\n\nThe fourteenth line of the code creates an integer called `flg` which is used to determine if the word should be added to the `new_lst` vector. The initial value of `flg` is 0.\n\nThe fifteenth line of the code checks if the length of the `word` string is 1. If it is, then `flg` is set to 1.\n\nThe sixteenth line of the code creates a for loop that checks if the length of the `word` string is a multiple of any number greater than 1. If it is, then `flg` is set to 1.\n\nThe seventeenth line of the code checks if `flg` is equal to 0 or if the length of the `word` string is 2. If either of these conditions is true, then the `word` string is added to the `new_lst` vector.\n\nThe eighteenth line of the code creates a string called `res` which is used to store the final result.\n\nThe nineteenth line of the code creates a for loop that iterates through each word in the `new_lst` vector.

If there is no such vowel, it returns an empty string. \n\nThe function is defined as `get_closest_vowel` and takes a single argument, `word`, which is the string to be processed. \n\nThe first line of the function checks if the length of the input string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns an empty string. \n\nThe next line creates a set of characters that represent vowels. \n\nThe for loop iterates over the characters in the input string, starting from the second-to-last character and moving backwards. \n\nFor each character, the loop checks if it is a vowel. If it is, it checks if the characters immediately before and after it are not vowels. If both conditions are true, the function returns the vowel as a string. \n\nIf the loop completes without finding a suitable vowel, the function returns an empty string. \n\nThe function makes use of several C++ libraries, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`.

The function returns a vector of long integers called `res`.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` library which is used for debugging purposes and the `bits/stdc++.h` library which includes all the standard libraries in C++. The next few lines include the `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` libraries.\n\nThe `compare` function takes in two vectors of long integers called `game` and `guess`. It creates an empty vector of long integers called `res`. It then loops through the `game` vector and calculates the absolute difference between the `i`th element of the `game` vector and the `i`th element of the `guess` vector. It then pushes this absolute difference to the `res` vector. Finally, it returns the `res` vector.\n\nThe `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers. The `push_back` function is used to add an element to the end of a vector. The `size` function is used to get the size of a vector. The `long` data type is used to represent long integers.

This library provides a macro called assert, which can be used to verify assumptions made by the program and print an error message if the assumption is false.\n\nThe second line includes the bits/stdc++.h library. This library includes all the standard libraries of C++. \n\nThe third line includes the vector library. This library provides a template class that implements a dynamic array. \n\nThe fourth line includes the sstream library.

This library provides classes and functions for working with regular expressions.\n\nThe sixth line includes the map library. This library provides a template class for working with associative arrays.\n\nThe seventh line includes the set library.

It then compares the two sets and returns true if they are equal, meaning that the two strings have the same characters. \n\nThe function does not modify the input strings. \n\nThe code does not have any syntax errors and should compile without issues. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_6_parse_nested_parens.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())') == [2, 3, 1, 3]\n    assert candidate('() (()) ((())) (((())))') == [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    assert candidate('(()(())((())))') == [4]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(parse_nested_parens)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The first integer in the tuple is the count of even digits in the input integer and the second integer in the tuple is the count of odd digits in the input integer. \n\nThe function is defined using the `std::tuple` class which is a container that groups multiple values together. The function is named `even_odd_count` and takes a single argument `num` of type `long`. \n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the count of even and odd digits in the input integer. \n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the string representation of the absolute value of the input integer. This is done using a range-based for loop. The `std::to_string` function is used to convert the input integer to a string. The `abs` function is used to get the absolute value of the input integer in case it is negative. \n\nFor each character in the string representation of the input integer, the function checks if the integer value of the character is even or odd. This is done by converting the character to an integer using the `int` function and then checking if the integer value is divisible by 2. If the integer value is divisible by 2, then the character is even and the `even_count` variable is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the character is odd and the `odd_count` variable is incremented by 1. \n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of `even_count` and `odd_count` using the `std::make_tuple` function. \n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, these headers are not actually used in the implementation of the `even_odd_count` function and can be removed. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef even_odd_count(num: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_67_fruit_distribution", "language": "py", "prompt": "def fruit_distribution(s: str, n: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_67_fruit_distribution.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('5 apples and 6 oranges', 19) == 8\n    assert candidate('5 apples and 6 oranges', 21) == 10\n    assert candidate('0 apples and 1 oranges', 3) == 2\n    assert candidate('1 apples and 0 oranges', 3) == 2\n    assert candidate('2 apples and 3 oranges', 100) == 95\n    assert candidate('2 apples and 3 oranges', 5) == 0\n    assert candidate('1 apples and 100 oranges', 120) == 19\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(fruit_distribution)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a long integer.\n\nThe function first creates an empty vector `lis` of integers. It then creates a stringstream object `ss` from the input string `s`. The stringstream object is used to extract words from the input string. The function then loops through each word in the input string and checks if it matches the regular expression `\\\\d+`. This regular expression matches any sequence of one or more digits. If a word matches the regular expression, it is converted to an integer using the `std::stoi` function and added to the `lis` vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all the integers in the `lis` vector. This effectively calculates the remaining number of fruits after distributing the fruits to `lis.size()` people, where each person gets `lis[i]` fruits. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef fruit_distribution(s: str, n: int) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_11_string_xor", "language": "py", "prompt": "def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_11_string_xor.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('111000', '101010') == '010010'\n    assert candidate('1', '1') == '0'\n    assert candidate('0101', '0000') == '0101'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(string_xor)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the characters are the same, the function appends a '0' to the `ans` string, otherwise it appends a '1'. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `ans` string. \n\nThe code also includes several header files, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. These header files provide various functions and data structures that are used in the implementation of the `string_xor` function. \n\nNote: The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is not part of the C++ standard library and is not portable across different compilers. It is often used in competitive programming to include all standard headers in one line. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_23_strlen", "language": "py", "prompt": "def strlen(string: str) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_23_strlen.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('') == 0\n    assert candidate('x') == 1\n    assert candidate('asdasnakj') == 9\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(strlen)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Python.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\nlong can_arrange(std::vector<long> arr) {\n    long ind=-1;\n    long i=1;\n    while (i<arr.size()) {\n      if (arr[i]<arr[i-1]) {\n        ind=i;\n      }\n      i+=1;\n    }\n    return ind;\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `can_arrange` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer. \n\nThe first line includes the `assert.h` library. This library provides a macro called `assert` that can be used to check if an expression is true. If the expression is false, the program will terminate with an error message. \n\nThe second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library. This library includes all the standard libraries of C++. \n\nThe third line declares a vector of long integers called `arr`. \n\nThe fourth line includes the `sstream` library. This library provides classes for working with strings. \n\nThe fifth line includes the `regex` library. This library provides classes for working with regular expressions. \n\nThe sixth line includes the `map` library. This library provides classes for working with associative arrays. \n\nThe seventh line includes the `set` library. This library provides classes for working with sets. \n\nThe `can_arrange` function takes a vector of long integers called `arr` as input. \n\nThe eighth line declares a long integer called `ind` and initializes it to -1. \n\nThe ninth line declares a long integer called `i` and initializes it to 1. \n\nThe while loop in lines 10-14 iterates over the elements of the vector `arr`. \n\nThe if statement in lines 11-13 checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it sets the value of `ind` to the current index. \n\nThe loop increments the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration. \n\nThe function returns the value of `ind` after the loop has finished executing. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef can_arrange(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_85_add", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef add(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_85_add.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([4, 88]) == 88\n    assert candidate([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122]) == 122\n    assert candidate([4, 0, 6, 7]) == 0\n    assert candidate([4, 4, 6, 8]) == 12\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(add)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The second line includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which is a shortcut for including all standard library headers. This is not recommended in production code, but is often used in competitive programming to save time.\n\nThe third line includes the header file `vector`, which provides a container for dynamic arrays. The fourth line includes the header file `sstream`, which provides a stream class for string manipulation. The fifth line includes the header file `regex`, which provides regular expression support. The sixth line includes the header file `map`, which provides a container for key-value pairs. The seventh line includes the header file `set`, which provides a container for unique elements.\n\nThe `add` function takes a vector of long integers as input and returns a long integer. The function initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates over the vector using a for loop, starting at index 1 and incrementing by 2. This means that the loop only considers even-indexed elements of the vector. For each even-indexed element, the function checks if it is even by using the modulo operator `%` to check if it is divisible by 2. If it is even, the element is added to `sum`. Finally, the function returns `sum`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef add(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_5_intersperse", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_5_intersperse.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([], 7) == []\n    assert candidate([5, 6, 3, 2], 8) == [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8, 2]\n    assert candidate([2, 2, 2], 2) == [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(intersperse)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The lambda function works by iterating over each character in the string and keeping track of the number of open parentheses encountered so far. If a closing parenthesis is encountered, the count is decremented. If the count ever becomes negative, it means that there are more closing parentheses than opening parentheses, and the function returns false. If the count is zero at the end of the iteration, it means that all opening parentheses have been matched with closing parentheses, and the function returns true.\n\nThe function then concatenates the two input strings in two different orders and checks if either of the resulting strings has balanced parentheses using the `check` lambda function. If either string has balanced parentheses, the function returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, it returns \"No\".\n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only the `vector` header is actually used in the implementation of the function. The other headers are not needed and can be removed. The `bits/stdc++.h` header is a non-standard header that includes all standard headers, but it is not recommended to use it in production code. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef match_parens(lst: List[str]) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([], 'john') == []\n    assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']\n    assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx') == ['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']\n    assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(filter_by_substring)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It then calculates the remainder of `number` divided by `num[i]`, and stores it back in `number`. \n\nThe function then enters another while loop that will continue until `div` is equal to 0. Within this while loop, the function appends the symbol `sym[i]` to `res`, and decrements `div` by 1. \n\nAfter the inner while loop completes, the function decrements `i` by 1, and the outer while loop continues. \n\nOnce the outer while loop completes, the function converts `res` to lowercase using the `std::transform` function, and returns `res`. \n\nThe function makes use of several C++ standard library functions, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`.

The function takes in an argument `n` which is a long integer. \n\nThe function returns a boolean value `true` if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, and `false` otherwise. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is even by checking if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is equal to 0. If `n` is not even, the function returns `false`. If `n` is even, the function checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8. If `n` is less than 8, the function returns `false`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 8, the function returns `true`. \n\nThe function is named `is_equal_to_sum_even` which suggests that it may be used to check if a number is equal to the sum of two even numbers. However, the function does not actually perform this check. \n\nThe code includes several header files at the beginning of the file.

The function checks if the two fractions represented by the input strings are equivalent. If they are, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nThe function first creates two stringstreams, `ss1` and `ss2`, from the input strings `x` and `n`. The stringstreams are used to extract the numerator and denominator of each fraction from the input strings.\n\nThe function then extracts the numerator and denominator of each fraction from the stringstreams using the `>>` operator. The `>>` operator is used to extract values from a stream and store them in a variable. In this case, the numerator and denominator of each fraction are extracted and stored in the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.\n\nThe function then calculates the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators of the two fractions. If the product of the numerators is divisible by the product of the denominators, the two fractions are equivalent and the function returns true. Otherwise, the function returns false.\n\nThe function uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. These headers provide various functions and data structures that are used in the implementation of the function. However, not all of these headers are actually used in the function, and some of them could be removed without affecting the functionality of the code. \n\nOverall, the function is relatively simple and could be easily translated to Python. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef simplify(x: str, n: str) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_161_solve", "language": "py", "prompt": "def solve(s: str) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_161_solve.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('AsDf') == 'aSdF'\n    assert candidate('1234') == '4321'\n    assert candidate('ab') == 'AB'\n    assert candidate('#a@C') == '#A@c'\n    assert candidate('#AsdfW^45') == '#aSDFw^45'\n    assert candidate('#6@2') == '2@6#'\n    assert candidate('#$a^D') == '#$A^d'\n    assert candidate('#ccc') == '#CCC'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(solve)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The toggling is done using the ternary operator `isupper(s[i]) ? tolower(s[i]) : toupper(s[i])`. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase, and vice versa. \n\nIf no characters were toggled, the function reverses the input string `s` using the `reverse` function from the `algorithm` library. \n\nFinally, the function returns the modified string `new_str`. \n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are preprocessor directives that include various libraries in the program.

The function checks if the three arguments form a right-angled triangle, and returns `true` if they do, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds for the three sides of the triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, the function checks if any of the three possible combinations of sides satisfy this equation.\n\nThe function uses the `==` operator to check if the equation holds for each combination of sides. If the equation holds for any of the combinations, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all standard library headers. This is a non-standard header file and is not recommended for use in production code.\n\nThe code also includes the `assert.h` header file, which provides a macro for debugging purposes. The `assert` macro checks if a given condition is true, and if it is not, it terminates the program and prints an error message.\n\nThe code uses the `vector`, `stringstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` classes from the standard library, but none of these are used in the `right_angle_triangle` function.

If the `balance` variable never becomes negative, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`.

The function takes a vector of long integers as input and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe function is defined as `bool monotonic(std::vector<long> l)`. The function takes a vector of long integers `l` as input and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe function checks if the vector is sorted in either ascending or descending order. If the vector is sorted in either ascending or descending order, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`. \n\nThe function uses the `std::is_sorted()` function to check if the vector is sorted. The `std::is_sorted()` function is a standard library function in C++ that checks if a range of elements is sorted in either ascending or descending order. \n\nThe `std::is_sorted()` function takes two arguments: the beginning and the end of the range to be checked. In this case, the beginning of the range is `l.begin()` and the end of the range is `l.end()`. \n\nThe `std::is_sorted()` function returns `true` if the range is sorted in ascending order and `false` otherwise. \n\nThe function also checks if the vector is sorted in descending order by using the `std::is_sorted()` function with the `rbegin()` and `rend()` iterators. The `rbegin()` and `rend()` iterators are used to iterate over the vector in reverse order. \n\nThe function returns `true` if the vector is sorted in either ascending or descending order and `false` otherwise. \n\nThe code also includes several header files, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. These header files are used to include various standard library functions and data structures. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that checks if a vector of long integers is monotonic. The function uses the `std::is_sorted()` function to check if the vector is sorted in either ascending or descending order and returns `true` if it is and `false` otherwise.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef monotonic(l: List[int]) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_105_by_length", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef by_length(arr: List[int]) -> List[str]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_105_by_length.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]) == ['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']\n    assert candidate([]) == []\n    assert candidate([1, -1, 55]) == ['One']\n    assert candidate([1, -1, 3, 2]) == ['Three', 'Two', 'One']\n    assert candidate([9, 4, 8]) == ['Nine', 'Eight', 'Four']\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(by_length)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `correct_bracketing` and takes a string `brackets` as input. The function returns a boolean value of `true` if the brackets are balanced and `false` if they are not.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `depth` to 0. The function then iterates through each character `b` in the string `brackets`. If the character is an opening bracket `<`, the `depth` variable is incremented by 1. If the character is a closing bracket `>`, the `depth` variable is decremented by 1. If the `depth` variable becomes negative at any point, it means that there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `false`. If the function reaches the end of the string and the `depth` variable is 0, it means that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `true`. \n\nThe function uses the `std::string` class from the C++ standard library to represent the input string.

The lambda function checks if the input number is 1 or 0, and returns false if it is. If the input number is 2, it returns true. Otherwise, it checks if the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and the number itself (exclusive). If it is, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.\n\nThe function then extracts the start and end points of the two input intervals using the `std::get` function and stores them in variables `l` and `r`, respectively. It then calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals by taking the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points, and subtracting the former from the latter. If the length is greater than 0 and is a prime number (as determined by the `is_prime` lambda function), the function returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\". \n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only the `tuple` class and the `std::get` function from the `tuple` header are actually used in the code. Therefore, these headers could be removed without affecting the functionality of the code. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef intersection(interval1: Tuple[int, int], interval2: Tuple[int, int]) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_78_hex_key", "language": "py", "prompt": "def hex_key(num: str) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_78_hex_key.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('AB') == 1\n    assert candidate('1077E') == 2\n    assert candidate('ABED1A33') == 4\n    assert candidate('2020') == 2\n    assert candidate('123456789ABCDEF0') == 6\n    assert candidate('112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00') == 12\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(hex_key)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

If the character is found in the `primes` string, the `total` variable is incremented by 1. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `total` variable as a long integer. \n\nThe purpose of the function is to count the number of prime characters in the input string `num`. A prime character is defined as a character that is in the `primes` string. \n\nThe `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` libraries are included at the beginning of the program, but they are not used in the `hex_key` function. \n\nThe `assert.h` library is used for debugging and testing purposes. \n\nThe `bits/stdc++.h` library is a shortcut for including all standard libraries in C++. \n\nThe `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` libraries are used for working with vectors, streams, regular expressions, maps, and sets respectively. However, they are not used in the `hex_key` function. \n\nOverall, the `hex_key` function is a simple implementation of counting the number of prime characters in a string. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef hex_key(num: str) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_70_strange_sort_list", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef strange_sort_list(lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_70_strange_sort_list.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]\n    assert candidate([5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == [5, 9, 6, 8, 7]\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]\n    assert candidate([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]) == [1, 9, 5, 8, 6, 7]\n    assert candidate([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]\n    assert candidate([]) == []\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4, 5]\n    assert candidate([0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5]) == [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n    assert candidate([111111]) == [111111]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(strange_sort_list)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The regular expression matches any of the characters `.`, `?`, or `!` followed by zero or more whitespace characters. \n\nThe function then uses the `std::sregex_token_iterator` function to split the input string into a vector of strings. The function takes four arguments: the first is the beginning of the input string, the second is the end of the input string, the third is the regular expression object `r`, and the fourth is an integer that specifies the maximum number of splits to perform. The value `-1` is used to indicate that all possible splits should be performed.\n\nThe resulting vector of strings `sentences` contains all the sentences in the input string. \n\nThe function then initializes a variable `res` to zero. The function then iterates over each sentence in the `sentences` vector. For each sentence, the function checks if the first two characters are \"I \". If they are, the function increments the `res` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `res`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\ndef is_bored(S: str) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_14_all_prefixes", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_14_all_prefixes.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('') == []\n    assert candidate('asdfgh') == ['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh']\n    assert candidate('WWW') == ['W', 'WW', 'WWW']\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(all_prefixes)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Python.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\nbool is_sorted(std::vector<long> lst) {\n    std::map<long, long> count_digit;\n    for (auto i: lst) {\n        count_digit[i]++;\n    }\n    for (auto i: lst) {\n        if (count_digit[i] > 2) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i < lst.size(); i++) {\n        if (lst[i-1] > lst[i]) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `is_sorted` that takes a vector of long integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vector is sorted in ascending order and has no more than two occurrences of each integer. \n\nThe function first creates an empty map called `count_digit` that will be used to keep track of the number of occurrences of each integer in the input vector. \n\nIt then iterates over the input vector and increments the count of each integer in the `count_digit` map. \n\nNext, it iterates over the input vector again and checks whether any integer has more than two occurrences. If so, it returns `false` because the input vector does not meet the criteria of having no more than two occurrences of each integer. \n\nFinally, it iterates over the input vector one last time and checks whether it is sorted in ascending order. If not, it returns `false`. If the input vector passes both checks, it returns `true`. \n\nThe function uses the `std::vector`, `std::map`, and `std::set` libraries, as well as the `assert.h` and `bits/stdc++.h` headers. It also uses the `regex` and `sstream` libraries, although they are not used in this particular implementation. \n\nTo rewrite this program in Python, one could use the `collections` module to create a dictionary to keep track of the number of occurrences of each integer in the input list. The function could then use the `sorted` function to check whether the input list is sorted in ascending order. \n\nHere is a possible Python implementation of the `is_sorted` function:\n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef is_sorted(lst: List[int]) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_69_search", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef search(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_69_search.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([5, 5, 5, 5, 1]) == 1\n    assert candidate([4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4]) == 4\n    assert candidate([3, 3]) == -1\n    assert candidate([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]) == 8\n    assert candidate([2, 3, 3, 2, 2]) == 2\n    assert candidate([2, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 3, 9, 6, 5, 10, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 4, 10, 8, 1]) == 1\n    assert candidate([3, 2, 8, 2]) == 2\n    assert candidate([6, 7, 1, 8, 8, 10, 5, 8, 5, 3, 10]) == 1\n    assert candidate([8, 8, 3, 6, 5, 6, 4]) == -1\n    assert candidate([6, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4, 7, 1, 8, 8, 9, 8, 10, 10, 8, 4, 10, 4, 10, 1, 2, 9, 5, 7, 9]) == 1\n    assert candidate([1, 9, 10, 1, 3]) == 1\n    assert candidate([6, 9, 7, 5, 8, 7, 5, 3, 7, 5, 10, 10, 3, 6, 10, 2, 8, 6, 5, 4, 9, 5, 3, 10]) == 5\n    assert candidate([1]) == 1\n    assert candidate([8, 8, 10, 6, 4, 3, 5, 8, 2, 4, 2, 8, 4, 6, 10, 4, 2, 1, 10, 2, 1, 1, 5]) == 4\n    assert candidate([2, 10, 4, 8, 2, 10, 5, 1, 2, 9, 5, 5, 6, 3, 8, 6, 4, 10]) == 2\n    assert candidate([1, 6, 10, 1, 6, 9, 10, 8, 6, 8, 7, 3]) == 1\n    assert candidate([9, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 7, 7, 7, 3, 10, 1, 5, 4, 2, 8, 4, 1, 9, 10, 7, 10, 2, 8, 10, 9, 4]) == 4\n    assert candidate([2, 6, 4, 2, 8, 7, 5, 6, 4, 10, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8, 8, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 10, 7]) == 4\n    assert candidate([9, 8, 6, 10, 2, 6, 10, 2, 7, 8, 10, 3, 8, 2, 6, 2, 3, 1]) == 2\n    assert candidate([5, 5, 3, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 8, 5, 6, 10, 10, 6, 8, 4, 10, 7, 7, 10, 8]) == -1\n    assert candidate([10]) == -1\n    assert candidate([9, 7, 7, 2, 4, 7, 2, 10, 9, 7, 5, 7, 2]) == 2\n    assert candidate([5, 4, 10, 2, 1, 1, 10, 3, 6, 1, 8]) == 1\n    assert candidate([7, 9, 9, 9, 3, 4, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 1, 1, 10, 7, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 6]) == 1\n    assert candidate([3, 10, 10, 9, 2]) == -1\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(search)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function finds the smallest integer that appears at least as many times as its value in the input vector. If there is no such integer, the function returns -1.\n\nThe function starts by creating a new vector called `frq` that has a length equal to the maximum element in the input vector plus one. The `frq` vector is initialized with zeros. This vector will be used to count the frequency of each integer in the input vector.\n\nThe function then loops through the input vector and increments the corresponding element in the `frq` vector for each integer in the input vector.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable called `ans` to -1. This variable will be used to store the answer to the problem.\n\nThe function then loops through the `frq` vector from index 1 to the end. For each index `i`, the function checks if the value at that index is greater than or equal to `i`. If it is, then the function sets `ans` to `i`. This is because `i` is the smallest integer that appears at least as many times as its value in the input vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`.\n\nTo rewrite this program in Python, we can use the following code:\n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef search(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_68_pluck", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef pluck(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_68_pluck.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([4, 2, 3]) == [2, 1]\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 1]\n    assert candidate([]) == []\n    assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 3]) == [0, 3]\n    assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4, 8]) == [4, 1]\n    assert candidate([7, 6, 7, 1]) == [6, 1]\n    assert candidate([7, 9, 7, 1]) == []\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(pluck)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function is called `pluck` and it is defined on line 6. The function takes in a vector of long integers called `arr`. \n\nThe first line of the function checks if the size of the input vector is zero. If it is, the function returns an empty vector. \n\nThe second line of the function creates an empty vector called `evens`. \n\nThe third line of the function loops through each element in the input vector `arr`. The loop variable is called `x`. \n\nThe fourth line of the function checks if the current element `x` is even. If it is, the element is added to the `evens` vector. \n\nThe fifth line of the function checks if the size of the `evens` vector is zero. If it is, the function returns an empty vector. \n\nThe sixth line of the function finds the minimum value in the `evens` vector and stores it in a variable called `min_val`. \n\nThe seventh line of the function returns a vector containing two elements. The first element is the minimum value in the `evens` vector and the second element is the index of the minimum value in the original input vector `arr`. \n\nThe function makes use of several C++ standard library functions and containers. These include `std::vector`, `std::min_element`, and `std::find`. \n\nThe `std::vector` container is used to store the input and output vectors. \n\nThe `std::min_element` function is used to find the minimum value in the `evens` vector. \n\nThe `std::find` function is used to find the index of the minimum value in the original input vector `arr`. \n\nThe function also includes several header files from the C++ standard library. These include `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, not all of these header files are actually used in the function. \n\nOverall, the `pluck` function takes an input vector of long integers, finds the minimum even value in the vector, and returns a vector containing the minimum value and its index in the original vector. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef pluck(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_43_pairs_sum_to_zero", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef pairs_sum_to_zero(l: List[int]) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_43_pairs_sum_to_zero.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False\n    assert candidate([1, 3, -2, 1]) == False\n    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False\n    assert candidate([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) == True\n    assert candidate([1]) == False\n    assert candidate([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]) == True\n    assert candidate([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 31]) == True\n    assert candidate([-3, 9, -1, 4, 2, 30]) == False\n    assert candidate([-3, 9, -1, 4, 2, 31]) == False\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(pairs_sum_to_zero)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The outer loop iterates over the first integer in each pair, while the inner loop iterates over the second integer in each pair.

The function returns the number of integers between 1 and 10^n that start with the digit 1 and end with any digit. \n\nThe function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers that start with 1 and end with any digit. \n\nThe formula for this is 18 * 10^(n-2). This is because there are 9 digits that can be used to end the number (0-9), and each of these digits can be paired with any of the 9 digits that can be used in the middle of the number (excluding 1, since it is already used as the first digit). This gives us 9*9 = 81 possible combinations. However, we have counted the number 1 followed by n-2 zeros twice (once for each of the two digits that can be used in the middle). Therefore, we subtract 1 from this count to get 81-1 = 80. Finally, we multiply this by 10 to account for the fact that there are 10 possible choices for the last digit (0-9), giving us 800. \n\nAlternatively, we can write this as 9 * 10^(n-1) - 9 * 10^(n-2) + 1, which gives the same result. \n\nThe function returns this value as the result. \n\nNote: The `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are preprocessor directives that include header files. These header files provide declarations and definitions for functions and objects used in the code. The specific header files included in this code are: \n\n- `assert.h`: Provides a macro for testing assertions. \n- `bits/stdc++.h`: A non-standard header file that includes all standard C++ headers. \n- `vector`: Provides a container for storing sequences of elements. \n- `sstream`: Provides classes for working with strings as streams of characters. \n- `regex`: Provides classes for working with regular expressions. \n- `map`: Provides a container for storing key-value pairs. \n- `set`: Provides a container for storing unique elements in sorted order. \n\nThese header files are not used in the `starts_one_ends` function, but may be used elsewhere in the program. \n\nThe `long` keyword before the function name and parameter indicates that the function returns a `long` integer. \n\nThe `pow` function is used to calculate powers of 10. It takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. \n\nThe `return` keyword is used to return a value from the function. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple mathematical calculation that can be easily translated to Python. \n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef starts_one_ends(n: int) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_30_get_positive", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef get_positive(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_30_get_positive.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]) == [4, 5, 6]\n    assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n    assert candidate([-1, -2]) == []\n    assert candidate([]) == []\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(get_positive)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The accumulate function adds each string in the vector to the initial value, resulting in a single concatenated string.\n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a string concatenation function using the accumulate function from the standard library. \n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_132_is_nested", "language": "py", "prompt": "def is_nested(string: str) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_132_is_nested.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('[[]]') == True\n    assert candidate('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') == False\n    assert candidate('[][]') == False\n    assert candidate('[]') == False\n    assert candidate('[[[[]]]]') == True\n    assert candidate('[]]]]]]]]]]') == False\n    assert candidate('[][][[]]') == True\n    assert candidate('[[]') == False\n    assert candidate('[]]') == False\n    assert candidate('[[]][[') == True\n    assert candidate('[[][]]') == True\n    assert candidate('') == False\n    assert candidate('[[[[[[[[') == False\n    assert candidate(']]]]]]]]') == False\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(is_nested)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function checks whether the string contains at least two nested square brackets. \n\nThe function starts by including the necessary libraries. The `assert.h` library is used to include the `assert` function, which is used to check whether a condition is true. The `bits/stdc++.h` library is a header file that includes all the standard libraries in C++. The `vector` library is used to create a dynamic array, the `sstream` library is used to manipulate strings, the `regex` library is used to perform regular expression matching, the `map` library is used to create a key-value pair, and the `set` library is used to create a set of unique elements.\n\nThe function `is_nested` takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value. The function checks whether the string contains at least two nested square brackets. \n\nThe function starts by creating two empty vectors, `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`, which will be used to store the indices of the opening and closing square brackets in the string. \n\nThe function then loops through the string character by character. If the character is an opening square bracket, its index is added to the `opening_bracket_index` vector. If the character is a closing square bracket, its index is added to the `closing_bracket_index` vector.\n\nThe `reverse` function is then called on the `closing_bracket_index` vector to reverse its order. \n\nThe function then initializes three variables, `cnt`, `i`, and `l`. `cnt` is used to keep track of the number of nested square brackets, `i` is used to keep track of the index of the current closing square bracket being checked, and `l` is the length of the `closing_bracket_index` vector.\n\nThe function then loops through the `opening_bracket_index` vector. For each index, it checks whether the index of the corresponding closing square bracket is less than the index of the current closing square bracket being checked. If it is, `cnt` is incremented and `i` is incremented to check the next closing square bracket.\n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, indicating that there are at least two nested square brackets in the string, and `false` otherwise.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\ndef is_nested(string: str) -> bool:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_48_is_palindrome", "language": "py", "prompt": "def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_48_is_palindrome.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('') == True\n    assert candidate('aba') == True\n    assert candidate('aaaaa') == True\n    assert candidate('zbcd') == False\n    assert candidate('xywyx') == True\n    assert candidate('xywyz') == False\n    assert candidate('xywzx') == False\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(is_palindrome)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function counts the number of integers in the vector `arr` whose digits sum to a positive number.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a long integer called `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of integers in `arr` whose digits sum to a positive number.\n\nThe function then enters a for loop that iterates over each element in the vector `arr`. The loop variable is an integer called `i`. The loop body starts by initializing a long integer called `n` to the value of the `i`th element in `arr`. The variable `n` will be used to store the current integer being processed.\n\nThe function then initializes a long integer called `neg` to 1. This variable will be used to keep track of whether the current integer is positive or negative. If the current integer is negative, `neg` will be set to -1.\n\nThe function then checks if the current integer `n` is negative. If it is, the function multiplies `n` by -1 and sets `neg` to -1. This ensures that `n` is always positive or zero.\n\nThe function then initializes an empty vector called `digits`. This vector will be used to store the digits of the current integer `n`.\n\nThe function then creates a stringstream called `ss` and uses it to convert the current integer `n` to a string. The string representation of `n` is stored in a string called `str`.\n\nThe function then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the string `str`. The loop variable is an integer called `j`. The loop body starts by pushing the difference between the `j`th character in `str` and the character '0' onto the vector `digits`. This converts the character to an integer and adds it to the vector `digits`.\n\nThe function then checks if the first element in the vector `digits` is negative. If it is, the function multiplies it by `neg`. This ensures that the first digit of `n` is negative if `n` is negative.\n\nThe function then initializes a long integer called `sum` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of the digits of `n`.\n\nThe function then enters a for loop that iterates over each element in the vector `digits`. The loop variable is an integer called `j`. The loop body starts by adding the `j`th element in `digits` to `sum`.\n\nThe function then checks if `sum` is greater than 0. If it is, the function increments `count`.\n\nAfter the for loop finishes iterating over all the elements in `arr`, the function returns the value of `count`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef count_nums(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_25_factorize", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_25_factorize.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(2) == [2]\n    assert candidate(4) == [2, 2]\n    assert candidate(8) == [2, 2, 2]\n    assert candidate(57) == [3, 19]\n    assert candidate(3249) == [3, 3, 19, 19]\n    assert candidate(185193) == [3, 3, 3, 19, 19, 19]\n    assert candidate(20577) == [3, 19, 19, 19]\n    assert candidate(18) == [2, 3, 3]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(factorize)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Otherwise, it checks if `k` is divisible by any number between 2 and `k-1`. If it is, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true. \n\nThe function then initializes a variable called `largest` to 1. \n\nIt then loops through all numbers between 2 and `n`, inclusive. For each number `j`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `j` and if `j` is prime (using the `is_prime` lambda function). If both conditions are true, it updates the value of `largest` to be the maximum of its current value and `j`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is the largest prime factor of `n`. \n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `largest_prime_factor` function, so they can be removed. \n\nHere is a Python implementation of the same function:\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_147_get_max_triples", "language": "py", "prompt": "def get_max_triples(n: int) -> int:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_147_get_max_triples.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(5) == 1\n    assert candidate(6) == 4\n    assert candidate(10) == 36\n    assert candidate(100) == 53361\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(get_max_triples)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in Python.\n\n### C++ version\n\n#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n#include<vector>\n#include<sstream>\n#include<regex>\n#include<map>\n#include<set>\nstd::string anti_shuffle(std::string s) {\n    std::stringstream ss(s);\n    std::string word, res;\n    while (ss >> word) {\n        std::sort(word.begin(), word.end());\n        res += word + \" \";\n    }\n    res.pop_back();\n    return res;\n}\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `anti_shuffle` that takes a string as input and returns a string as output. The function sorts each word in the input string alphabetically and returns the resulting string. \n\nThe function first creates a `stringstream` object called `ss` that is initialized with the input string `s`. The `stringstream` class is a stream class that operates on strings. It provides a convenient way to read and write data to and from strings. \n\nThe function then creates two strings called `word` and `res`. `word` is used to store each word in the input string, and `res` is used to store the resulting string. \n\nThe function then enters a loop that reads each word from the `stringstream` object `ss` and sorts it alphabetically using the `std::sort` function. The sorted word is then appended to the `res` string along with a space character. \n\nAfter all the words have been processed, the last space character is removed from the `res` string using the `pop_back` function. The resulting string is then returned. \n\nThe function makes use of several C++ standard library functions and classes, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only the `sstream` class and the `std::sort` function are used in the implementation of the `anti_shuffle` function. \n\nTo rewrite the program in Python, we can use the `split` method of the `str` class to split the input string into a list of words, sort each word using the `sorted` function, and then join the sorted words back into a string using the `join` method of the `str` class. Here is the Python implementation:\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_84_solve", "language": "py", "prompt": "def solve(N: int) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_84_solve.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(1000) == '1'\n    assert candidate(150) == '110'\n    assert candidate(147) == '1100'\n    assert candidate(333) == '1001'\n    assert candidate(963) == '10010'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(solve)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It then initializes a variable `val` to `n * n + 1`. \n\nThe function then loops through each element of the input `grid` and checks if the element is equal to 1. If it is, it creates a vector `temp` and adds the values of the elements of `grid` that are adjacent to the current element to `temp`. It then sets `val` to the minimum value of `temp`.\n\nThe function then initializes an empty vector `ans` and loops through `k` times. If the current index is even, it adds 1 to `ans`. Otherwise, it adds the value of `val` to `ans`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `ans`.\n\n\n### Python version\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef minPath(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_89_encrypt", "language": "py", "prompt": "def encrypt(s: str) -> str:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_89_encrypt.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate('hi') == 'lm'\n    assert candidate('asdfghjkl') == 'ewhjklnop'\n    assert candidate('gf') == 'kj'\n    assert candidate('et') == 'ix'\n    assert candidate('faewfawefaewg') == 'jeiajeaijeiak'\n    assert candidate('hellomyfriend') == 'lippsqcjvmirh'\n    assert candidate('dxzdlmnilfuhmilufhlihufnmlimnufhlimnufhfucufh') == 'hbdhpqrmpjylqmpyjlpmlyjrqpmqryjlpmqryjljygyjl'\n    assert candidate('a') == 'e'\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(encrypt)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and returns a string `out` as output. \n\nThe first line includes the `assert.h` library, which is used to verify assumptions made by the program and print an error message if the assumption is false. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which includes all the standard libraries in C++. The third line includes the `vector` library, which is used to create dynamic arrays. The fourth line includes the `sstream` library, which is used to read and write strings. The fifth line includes the `regex` library, which is used to work with regular expressions. The sixth line includes the `map` library, which is used to create key-value pairs. The seventh line includes the `set` library, which is used to create sets.\n\nThe function `encrypt` creates a string `d` that contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet. It then creates an empty string `out`. The function then loops through each character `c` in the input string `s`. If `c` is a lowercase letter, the function finds the index of `c` in the string `d` and adds the letter that is two positions to the right of `c` in `d` to the output string `out`. If `c` is not a lowercase letter, the function adds `c` to `out`. The function then returns `out`. \n\nTo rewrite this program in Python, we can remove the first line since Python does not have an equivalent library. We can also remove the second line since Python includes all the standard libraries by default. We can replace the third line with `from typing import List`. We can remove the fourth line since Python does not need to read and write strings. We can remove the fifth line since Python has built-in support for regular expressions. We can replace the sixth line with `from collections import defaultdict`. We can replace the seventh line with `from typing import Set`. Finally, we can replace the `std::string` type with the `str` type in Python.\n\n\n### Python version\n\ndef encrypt(s: str) -> str:\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_100_make_a_pile", "language": "py", "prompt": "from typing import List\n\ndef make_a_pile(n: int) -> List[int]:\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_100_make_a_pile.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(3) == [3, 5, 7]\n    assert candidate(4) == [4, 6, 8, 10]\n    assert candidate(5) == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n    assert candidate(6) == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]\n    assert candidate(8) == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]\n\ndef test_check():\n    check(make_a_pile)\n\ntest_check()\n", "stop_tokens": ["\ndef", "\n#", "\nif", "\nclass"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.
