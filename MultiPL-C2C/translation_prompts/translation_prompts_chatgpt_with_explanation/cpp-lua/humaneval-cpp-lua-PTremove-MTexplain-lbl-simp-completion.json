If `n` has no odd digits, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables: `product` and `odd_count`. `product` is initialized to 1, and `odd_count` is initialized to 0. \n\nThe function then loops through each digit in `n`. To do this, it first converts `n` to a string using `std::to_string(n)`. It then iterates through each character in the string using a range-based for loop. \n\nFor each character, the function first converts it to an integer by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from the character. This gives us the integer value of the digit. \n\nThe function then checks if the digit is odd by checking if the integer value of the digit modulo 2 is equal to 1. If the digit is odd, the function multiplies `product` by the digit and increments `odd_count`. \n\nAfter iterating through all the digits in `n`, the function checks if `odd_count` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns `product`. \n\nThe function uses several C++ standard library functions and data structures. These include:\n- `std::to_string(n)`: Converts the long integer `n` to a string.\n- `std::vector`: A dynamic array used to store elements of a certain type.\n- `std::stringstream`: A stream class used to read from and write to strings.\n- `std::regex`: A regular expression library used to search and manipulate strings.\n- `std::map`: An associative container that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the keys.\n- `std::set`: An associative container that stores unique elements in a sorted order.\n- `std::unordered_map`: An associative container that stores key-value pairs in an unordered manner.\n- `std::unordered_set`: An associative container that stores unique elements in an unordered manner. \n\nThe code also includes several C++ standard library headers:\n- `assert.h`: Provides a macro for debugging purposes.\n- `bits/stdc++.h`: A non-standard header that includes all standard headers.\n- `vector`: Provides the `std::vector` container and related functions.\n- `sstream`: Provides the `std::stringstream` class and related functions.\n- `regex`: Provides the `std::regex` library and related functions.\n- `map`: Provides the `std::map` container and related functions.\n- `set`: Provides the `std::set` container and related functions.\n- `unordered_map`: Provides the `std::unordered_map` container and related functions.\n- `unordered_set`: Provides the `std::unordered_set` container and related functions. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function digits(n)\n"

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. \n\nThe program starts by including the necessary header files, which are assert.h, bits/stdc++.h, vector, sstream, regex, map, set, unordered_map, and unordered_set. These header files are used to provide access to various functions and classes that are used in the program.\n\nThe program then defines a function called fib4 that takes a long integer n as input and returns a long integer. The function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using a vector called results. \n\nThe vector results is initialized with the first four numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, which are 0, 0, 2, and 0. If n is less than 4, the function returns the nth number in the vector results. Otherwise, the function enters a for loop that iterates from 4 to n. \n\nIn each iteration of the for loop, the function calculates the next number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the first four numbers in the results vector. The first number in the results vector is then removed, and the next number is added to the end of the vector. \n\nAfter the for loop has completed, the function returns the fourth number in the results vector, which is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nOverall, the program is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in C++. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function fib4(n)\n"

The function returns a string that is the result of circularly shifting the digits of `x` by `shift` positions. \n\nThe function first converts the long integer `x` to a string `s` using the `std::to_string` function. \n\nIf `shift` is greater than the length of the string `s`, the function returns the reverse of the string `s` using the `std::string(s.rbegin(), s.rend())` function. \n\nOtherwise, the function returns a substring of `s` that starts at the index `s.size() - shift` and has length `shift`, concatenated with a substring of `s` that starts at the index `0` and has length `s.size() - shift`. This is done using the `s.substr` function. \n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are preprocessor directives that include the necessary header files for the code to work. The `assert.h` header file is used to include the `assert` function, which is used to check if a condition is true and terminate the program if it is not. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is a shortcut that includes all standard library headers. The `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` headers are used for various operations in the code. \n\nThe `std::` prefix is used to indicate that the functions and objects being used are part of the standard library namespace. This is done to avoid naming conflicts with user-defined functions and objects. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a circular shift function that can be easily rewritten in Lua. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function circular_shift(x, shift)\n"

The function is named `max_fill`.\n\nThe function calculates the maximum number of containers of a given capacity that can be filled with the contents of the 2D vector. The capacity of each container is specified by the second argument to the function.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates over each row of the 2D vector using a range-based for loop. For each row, it calculates the sum of the elements in the row using the `std::accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header. The `std::accumulate` function takes three arguments: the beginning and end iterators of the range to be summed, and an initial value for the sum. In this case, the range is the current row of the 2D vector, and the initial value is 0.\n\nThe sum of the row is then divided by the capacity of each container using the `ceil` function from the `<cmath>` header. The `ceil` function takes a single argument and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument. In this case, the argument is the sum of the row divided by the capacity of each container.\n\nThe result of the division is added to the `sum` variable. Once all rows have been processed, the `sum` variable contains the maximum number of containers that can be filled with the contents of the 2D vector. This value is returned by the function.\n\nThe function uses several headers: `<assert.h>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<vector>`, `<sstream>`, `<regex>`, `<map>`, and `<set>`. However, only `<vector>` is actually used in the function. The other headers are not necessary and can be removed. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function max_fill(grid, capacity)\n"

The function takes in three arguments, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and returns either `x` or `y` depending on whether `n` is a prime number or not. \n\nThe first line of the program includes the `assert.h` library, which is used to verify that certain conditions are met in the program. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is a header file that includes all standard libraries in C++. \n\nThe third line declares a vector of type `long`. A vector is a dynamic array that can be resized during runtime. The fourth line declares a `stringstream` object. A `stringstream` is a stream class that can be used to read and write from strings. \n\nThe fifth line declares a `regex` object. A `regex` is a regular expression that can be used to match patterns in strings. The sixth line declares a `map` object. A `map` is an associative container that stores key-value pairs. The seventh line declares a `set` object. A `set` is an associative container that stores unique elements in sorted order. \n\nThe `x_or_y` function takes in three arguments, `n`, `x`, and `y`. The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns `y`. \n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n-1`. The for loop checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `y` and breaks out of the for loop. \n\nIf `n` is not divisible by any number from 2 to `n-1`, the function returns `x`. \n\nThe program does not have any input or output statements, so it cannot be tested without modification. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function x_or_y(n, x, y)\n"

The function counts the number of elements in the input vector that are greater than 10 and have an odd first and last digit. \n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable called `count` to 0. \n\nIt then iterates over each element in the input vector using a range-based for loop. \n\nFor each element, it checks if it is greater than 10. If it is, it converts the element to a string using the `std::to_string` function. \n\nIt then checks if the first and last characters of the string representation of the number are odd. It does this by checking if the ASCII value of the first and last characters are odd. \n\nIf both the first and last characters are odd, it increments the `count` variable. \n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `count`. \n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, none of these headers are actually used in the implementation of the `specialFilter` function, so they can be removed. \n\nThe resulting Lua implementation of the function would look like this:\n\n```lua\nfunction specialFilter(nums)\n    local count = 0\n    for _, num in ipairs(nums) do\n        if num > 10 then\n            local number_as_string = tostring(num)\n            if tonumber(string.sub(number_as_string, 1, 1)) % 2 == 1 and tonumber(string.sub(number_as_string, -1)) % 2 == 1 then\n                count = count + 1\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return count\nend\n```\n\nThe Lua implementation is functionally equivalent to the original C++ implementation, but uses Lua-specific syntax and functions. The `for` loop uses the `ipairs` function to iterate over the elements of the input vector, and the `string.sub` function is used to extract the first and last characters of the string representation of the number. The `tonumber` function is used to convert the extracted characters back to numbers for comparison. The `tostring` function is used to convert the input number to a string. The `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set` headers are not used in the Lua implementation and can be removed.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function specialFilter(nums)\n"

The function is called `parse_music` and takes a single argument `music_string` of type `std::string`.\n\nThe function starts by defining a `std::map` called `note_map` that maps strings representing note durations to their corresponding integer values. The keys in the map are `\"o\"`, `\"o|\"` and `\".|\"`, which represent whole notes, half notes and quarter notes respectively. The values are `4`, `2` and `1` respectively.\n\nThe function then creates an empty vector of long integers called `res`.\n\nIt then creates a `std::istringstream` object called `iss` from the `music_string` argument. This object is used to read the string as if it were a stream of input.\n\nThe function then enters a while loop that reads each note from the `iss` stream and checks if it is a valid note duration by checking if it is a key in the `note_map` map. If it is, the corresponding value is added to the `res` vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` vector.\n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function parse_music(music_string)\n"

The function splits the input string into words based on either spaces or commas, and returns a vector of the words if the input string contains spaces or commas. If the input string does not contain spaces or commas, the function returns the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an even ASCII value.\n\nThe function returns a `Union_std_vector_std_string__long` object, which is a union of a `std::vector<std::string>` and a `long`. The union allows the function to return either a vector of strings or a long integer depending on the input string.\n\nThe function first checks if the input string contains spaces or commas by using the `find` method of the `std::string` class. If the input string contains spaces, the function creates a vector of strings by using a `std::stringstream` to split the input string into words. If the input string contains commas, the function creates a vector of strings by using the `getline` method of the `std::stringstream` class to split the input string into words. If the input string does not contain spaces or commas, the function counts the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an even ASCII value by iterating over the characters in the string and checking their ASCII values.\n\nThe `Union_std_vector_std_string__long` class defines two constructors that allow the union to be initialized with either a vector of strings or a long integer. The class also defines two `operator==` methods that allow the union to be compared with either a vector of strings or a long integer. The `operator==` methods return `true` if the union contains the same value as the input argument. \n\nThe code includes several header files that provide access to various C++ standard library functions and classes. The `assert.h` header file provides the `assert` macro, which can be used to check for logical errors in the code. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes all the standard C++ headers, which can save time when writing code. The `vector` header file provides the `std::vector` class, which is used to store a dynamic array of objects. The `sstream` header file provides the `std::stringstream` class, which is used to convert a string to a stream of words. The `regex` header file provides regular expression support, which is not used in this code. The `map` and `set` header files provide the `std::map` and `std::set` classes, which are used to store key-value pairs and sets of unique values, respectively. The `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` header files provide the `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` classes, which are similar to `std::map` and `std::set`, but use a hash table for faster access. \n\nThe `split_words` function is defined outside of any class, which makes it a global function that can be called from anywhere in the code. The function takes a single argument `txt`, which is a string. The function returns a `Union_std_vector_std_string__long` object, which is either a vector of strings or a long integer. \n\nThe `split_words` function is implemented using an if-else statement that checks if the input string contains spaces or commas. If the input string contains spaces, the function creates a vector of strings by using a `std::stringstream` to split the input string into words. If the input string contains commas, the function creates a vector of strings by using the `getline` method of\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function split_words(txt)\n"

The function is defined as follows:\n\n```C++\nstd::vector<std::string> bf(std::string planet1, std::string planet2) {\n```\n\nThe function takes two strings as input, `planet1` and `planet2`. The function returns a vector of strings.\n\n```C++\nstd::vector<std::string> planet_names = {\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"};\n```\n\nA vector of strings `planet_names` is defined and initialized with the names of the planets in our solar system.\n\n```C++\nif (std::find(planet_names.begin(), planet_names.end(), planet1) == planet_names.end() || std::find(planet_names.begin(), planet_names.end(), planet2) == planet_names.end() || planet1 == planet2) {\n    return {};\n}\n```\n\nThe function first checks if either `planet1` or `planet2` is not in the `planet_names` vector or if `planet1` is equal to `planet2`. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns an empty vector.\n\n```C++\nint planet1_index = std::find(planet_names.begin(), planet_names.end(), planet1) - planet_names.begin();\nint planet2_index = std::find(planet_names.begin(), planet_names.end(), planet2) - planet_names.begin();\n```\n\nThe function then finds the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planet_names` vector.\n\n```C++\nif (planet1_index < planet2_index) {\n    return {planet_names.begin() + planet1_index + 1, planet_names.begin() + planet2_index};\n} else {\n    return {planet_names.begin() + planet2_index + 1, planet_names.begin() + planet1_index};\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the function returns a subvector of `planet_names` that contains all the planets between `planet1` and `planet2`. If `planet1` comes before `planet2` in the `planet_names` vector, the function returns a subvector that starts from the planet after `planet1` and ends at the planet before `planet2`. Otherwise, the function returns a subvector that starts from the planet after `planet2` and ends at the planet before `planet1`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function bf(planet1, planet2)\n"

The function calculates the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in the input string. \n\nThe first line of the code includes the header file `assert.h` which is used for debugging purposes.

The fifth line includes the header file `regex` which is used for regular expression processing. The sixth line includes the header file `map` which is used to create associative arrays. The seventh line includes the header file `set` which is used to create sets.\n\nThe function `digitSum` takes a string `s` as input. If the string is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes a long integer variable `ans` to 0. The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`. If the character is an uppercase letter, the ASCII value of the character is added to the variable `ans`. Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function digitSum(s)\n"

Otherwise, `is_prime` is set to `true`. \n\nIf `is_prime` is `true`, then the number `i` is added to the `primes` vector using the `push_back` method. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `primes` vector. \n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are preprocessor directives that include various libraries needed for the code to run. \n\n`<assert.h>` is a library that provides a macro called `assert` that can be used for debugging purposes. \n\n`<bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file that includes all standard library headers. \n\n`<vector>` is a library that provides a container class called `vector` that can be used to store a dynamic array of elements. \n\n`<sstream>` is a library that provides a class called `stringstream` that can be used to manipulate strings. \n\n`<regex>` is a library that provides regular expression matching. \n\n`<map>` is a library that provides a container class called `map` that can be used to store key-value pairs. \n\n`<set>` is a library that provides a container class called `set` that can be used to store unique elements in sorted order. \n\nThe `std::` prefix is used to indicate that the libraries are part of the standard namespace. \n\nThe `long` data type is used to represent integers that are at least 32 bits long. \n\nThe `bool` data type is used to represent boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`. \n\nThe `push_back` method is used to add an element to the end of a vector. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a prime number generator that uses basic loops and vector manipulation. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function count_up_to(n)\n"

The function returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the numbers that are multiples of 11 or 13 up to `n`. \n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` header file which provides a macro `assert` that can be used to check if a condition is true. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file which includes all the standard C++ libraries. The third line includes the `vector` header file which provides a container that can hold a dynamic array of elements. The fourth line includes the `sstream` header file which provides a stream that can be used to read from or write to a string. The fifth line includes the `regex` header file which provides a library for regular expressions. The sixth line includes the `map` header file which provides a container that can hold a collection of key-value pairs. The seventh line includes the `set` header file which provides a container that can hold a collection of unique elements.\n\nThe function `fizz_buzz` creates an empty vector `ns` to hold the numbers that are multiples of 11 or 13 up to `n`. It then loops through all the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the number is a multiple of 11 or 13. If the number is a multiple of 11 or 13, it is added to the `ns` vector. \n\nThe function then creates a stringstream `ss` and loops through all the numbers in the `ns` vector. It appends each number to the stringstream. The stringstream is then converted to a string `s`.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and loops through all the characters in the string `s`. If a character is equal to the character '7', the variable `ans` is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `ans`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function fizz_buzz(n)\n"

The function returns a string that is the concatenation of `class_name`, a period, and the string in `extensions` that has the most uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters.\n\nThe function starts by initializing the variable `strong` to be the first element in the `extensions` vector. It then calculates the value of `my_val` by counting the number of uppercase letters in `strong` and subtracting the number of lowercase letters in `strong`. This value will be used to compare against the values of other strings in the `extensions` vector.\n\nThe function then loops through each string `s` in the `extensions` vector. For each string, it calculates the value of `val` in the same way as `my_val`. If `val` is greater than `my_val`, then `strong` is set to `s` and `my_val` is set to `val`.\n\nFinally, the function concatenates `class_name`, a period, and `strong` to form the return value. This value is then returned by the function.\n\nThe function makes use of several C++ standard library functions and classes, including `std::count_if`, `std::isupper`, `std::islower`, `std::string`, and `std::vector`. It also includes several header files, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, some of these header files may not be necessary for this specific implementation and could be removed. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions)\n"

However, none of these headers are actually used in the implementation of the `find_closest_elements` function, so they can be removed. \n\nThe resulting simplified code is:\n\n```\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function find_closest_elements(numbers)\n"

The function checks if the input string is a valid date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\" and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.\n\nThe function first tries to extract the date part of the input string by finding the first space character and taking the substring before it. This is done using the `substr` function of the string class.\n\nThe date string is then parsed using the `sscanf` function which is a C-style function for parsing formatted input. The format string `\"%d-%d-%d\"` specifies that the input should be in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\" and the three integers `month`, `day`, and `year` are extracted from the input string and stored in their respective variables.\n\nThe function then checks if the month is between 1 and 12, inclusive. If it is not, the function returns false.\n\nIf the month is valid, the function checks if the day is valid for that month. If the month is one of January, March, May, July, August, October, or December, the day must be between 1 and 31, inclusive. If the month is one of April, June, September, or November, the day must be between 1 and 30, inclusive. If the month is February, the day must be between 1 and 29, inclusive (since this code does not account for leap years).\n\nIf any of the checks fail, the function returns false. If all checks pass, the function returns true.\n\nThe code includes several header files, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, only the `bits/stdc++.h` header file is actually used in the code. This header file includes all other standard C++ header files, so it is often used to simplify code.\n\nThe `try` and `catch` blocks are used to catch any exceptions that might be thrown during the execution of the code. However, since no exceptions are actually thrown in this code, this block is not strictly necessary.\n\nOverall, the code is a relatively simple implementation of a date validation function in C++. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function valid_date(date)\n"

The numbers are represented as English words, e.g., \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", etc. The function uses a map to convert the English words to integers, sorts the integers, and then converts them back to English words.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` header file, which provides a macro for testing assertions. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all the standard C++ headers. This is a non-standard header file that is not guaranteed to be available on all platforms, but is commonly used in competitive programming.\n\nThe third line defines the `sort_numbers` function, which takes a string `numbers` as input and returns a string. The function begins by defining a map `value_map` that maps English words to integers. The map is initialized with the numbers from zero to nine. \n\nThe fourth line defines a vector `nums` to store the numbers in the input string. The fifth line creates a `stringstream` object `ss` from the input string. The `stringstream` class provides a convenient way to read from a string as if it were a stream. The sixth line defines a string `num` to store each number as it is read from the `stringstream`. The while loop on the seventh line reads each number from the `stringstream` and appends it to the `nums` vector.\n\nThe eighth line sorts the `nums` vector in ascending order using a lambda function that compares the values in the `value_map`. The lambda function takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and returns `true` if the value of `a` in the `value_map` is less than the value of `b` in the `value_map`. The lambda function captures the `value_map` by reference using the `&` symbol.\n\nThe ninth line defines a string `res` to store the sorted numbers. The for loop on the tenth line appends each number in the `nums` vector to the `res` string, separated by a space. The eleventh line removes the trailing space from the `res` string using the `pop_back` function. The twelfth line returns the `res` string.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function sort_numbers(numbers)\n"

If they are not equal, it increments the `ans` variable. \n\nAfter the loop is done, the function returns the value of `ans`. \n\nThe purpose of the function is to count the number of changes needed to make the vector a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. In this case, the vector is considered a palindrome if the first half of the vector is the same as the second half of the vector when read in reverse order. \n\nThe function achieves this by counting the number of elements in the first half of the vector that are not the same as the corresponding elements in the second half of the vector. This is because changing any of these elements will make the vector a palindrome. \n\nThe function assumes that the input vector `arr` has an even number of elements. If the vector has an odd number of elements, the middle element is ignored. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function smallest_change(arr)\n"

If it is, the function returns `std::nullopt`.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable `prod` to 0. It also counts the number of negative integers in the vector using `std::count_if` and stores the count in `neg_count`.\n\nIf the vector contains a 0, the function sets `prod` to 0. Otherwise, it sets `prod` to -1 raised to the power of `neg_count`.\n\nThe function then initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and iterates over the input vector, adding the absolute value of each integer to `sum`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the product of `prod` and `sum`. \n\nThe code makes use of several C++ standard library functions, including `std::find`, `std::count_if`, `std::abs`, `std::pow`, and `std::optional`.

The function works as follows:\n\n1. It creates an empty vector `odd_digit_elements` to store the odd digit elements.\n2. It loops through each element `i` in the input vector `x`.\n3. For each element `i`, it sets a boolean variable `is_odd` to `true`.\n4. It loops through each character `c` in the string representation of `i`.\n5. For each character `c`, it checks if it is an odd digit by checking if its value modulo 2 is equal to 1.\n6. If the character `c` is not an odd digit, it sets `is_odd` to `false` and breaks out of the loop.\n7. If all characters in the string representation of `i` are odd digits, it adds `i` to the `odd_digit_elements` vector.\n8. After all elements in `x` have been processed, it sorts the `odd_digit_elements` vector in ascending order.\n9. It returns the `odd_digit_elements` vector.\n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are preprocessor directives that include the necessary header files for the code to compile and run. The `assert.h` header file provides the `assert` macro for debugging purposes. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file is a shortcut that includes all standard C++ headers. The `vector` header file provides the `vector` container class for dynamic arrays. The `sstream` header file provides the `stringstream` class for string manipulation. The `regex` header file provides regular expression support. The `map` header file provides the `map` container class for key-value pairs. The `set` header file provides the `set` container class for sorted unique elements. \n\nThe `std::` prefix before each container class and function call is necessary to indicate that they are part of the `std` namespace, which is the standard namespace for C++ libraries. \n\nThe `auto` keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer. \n\nThe `to_string` function is a standard library function that converts a number to its string representation. \n\nThe `sort` function is a standard library function that sorts a range of elements in ascending order. \n\nThe `return` statement is used to return a value from the function. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function unique_digits(x)\n"

The function returns a boolean value.\n\nThe function first checks if the sum of the elements in the vector `q` is greater than `w`. If it is, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, the function proceeds to check if the vector `q` is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns `true`. If it is not, the function returns `false`.\n\nA palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. In this case, the vector `q` is considered a palindrome if the first element is equal to the last element, the second element is equal to the second-to-last element, and so on.\n\nThe function uses the `std::accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` header to calculate the sum of the elements in the vector `q`. The function then uses a while loop to check if the vector `q` is a palindrome. The loop starts with two indices: `i` at the beginning of the vector and `j` at the end of the vector. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `j`. At each iteration, the loop checks if the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `j`. If they are not equal, the function returns `false`. If they are equal, the loop increments `i` and decrements `j` and continues to the next iteration.\n\nThe function uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all standard headers. This is not considered good practice, as it can lead to longer compilation times and potential naming conflicts. The function also uses the `<regex>` header, which provides support for regular expressions. However, regular expressions are not used in this function.\n\nOverall, the function checks if a vector of integers is a palindrome and if the sum of the elements in the vector is less than or equal to a given value. The function returns `true` if both conditions are met and `false` otherwise. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function will_it_fly(q, w)\n"

The function checks if `a` is a product of three prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive). \n\nThe function defines a lambda function called `is_prime` that takes in a long integer `n` and returns a boolean value. The lambda function checks if `n` is a prime number by iterating from 2 to `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If `n` is divisible by any number in that range, the lambda function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.\n\nThe function then iterates through all possible combinations of three prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive) using three nested `for` loops. It checks if the product of the three prime numbers is equal to `a`. If it is, the function returns `true`. If no combination of three prime numbers results in a product equal to `a`, the function returns `false`. \n\nThe code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all standard library headers. It also includes the `assert.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` header files, but these are not used in the code. \n\nOverall, the code is checking if a given number is a product of three prime numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive). \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_multiply_prime(a)\n"

The function returns the vector with the smaller total length.\n\nThe function starts by including the header files `assert.h` and `bits/stdc++.h`. The former is used to include the `assert` function which is used to check if a condition is true and terminate the program if it is not. The latter is a non-standard header file that includes all the standard library headers. This is done to save time and effort in including individual headers.\n\nThe function then declares a vector of strings `total_match` that takes two vectors of strings `lst1` and `lst2` as input. \n\nThe function then initializes two integer variables `l1` and `l2` to 0. These variables will be used to store the total length of the strings in `lst1` and `lst2` respectively.\n\nThe function then loops through each string `st` in `lst1` and adds the length of `st` to `l1`. This is done using a range-based for loop.\n\nThe function then loops through each string `st` in `lst2` and adds the length of `st` to `l2`. This is also done using a range-based for loop.\n\nThe function then checks if `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`. If this is true, then the function returns `lst1`. Otherwise, the function returns `lst2`. \n\nThe function does not modify the input vectors `lst1` and `lst2`. \n\nThe function does not handle errors or exceptions. \n\nThe function does not have any side effects. \n\nThe function is not dependent on any external state or input. \n\nThe function is not recursive. \n\nThe function is not multithreaded. \n\nThe function is not templated. \n\nThe function is not overloaded. \n\nThe function is not virtual. \n\nThe function is not a member of a class. \n\nThe function does not use any external libraries or APIs. \n\nThe function is not platform-dependent. \n\nThe function is not time-dependent. \n\nThe function is not space-dependent. \n\nThe function is not language-dependent. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function total_match(lst1, lst2)\n"

The function checks if `x` is a power of `n` and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function starts by checking if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `true` if `x` is also equal to 1, and `false` otherwise. This is because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself, so if `n` is 1, `x` must also be 1 for `x` to be a power of `n`.\n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function initializes a variable `power` to 1 and enters a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, `power` is multiplied by `n` until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is a power of `n`, then `power` will eventually become equal to `x`. If `x` is not a power of `n`, then `power` will eventually become greater than `x`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `power` is equal to `x`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe code uses the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which includes all the standard headers in the C++ library. It also includes the `assert.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` headers, although these are not used in the function itself. The `assert.h` header is used for debugging purposes, and the other headers may be used elsewhere in the program.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_simple_power(x, n)\n"

The function replaces all vowels in the input string with the vowel two letters ahead of it in the alphabet, and then toggles the case of all the letters in the string. \n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` library, which is used to include the `assert` function. The `assert` function is used to check if a condition is true, and if it is not, the program will terminate with an error message. \n\nThe second line of the code includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is a header file that includes all the standard libraries in C++. \n\nThe third line of the code includes the `vector` library, which is used to create a vector. A vector is a dynamic array that can change size during runtime. \n\nThe fourth line of the code includes the `sstream` library, which is used to convert strings to other data types and vice versa. \n\nThe fifth line of the code includes the `regex` library, which is used to work with regular expressions. \n\nThe sixth line of the code includes the `map` library, which is used to create a map. A map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. \n\nThe seventh line of the code includes the `set` library, which is used to create a set. A set is a collection of unique elements. \n\nThe eighth line of the code defines the `encode` function, which takes a string called `message` as input and returns a string as output. \n\nThe ninth line of the code defines a string called `vowels` that contains all the vowels in the English language, both uppercase and lowercase. \n\nThe tenth line of the code defines a map called `vowels_replace` that will be used to replace each vowel in the input string with the vowel two letters ahead of it in the alphabet. \n\nThe eleventh line of the code uses a for loop to iterate over each vowel in the `vowels` string. For each vowel, the code adds a key-value pair to the `vowels_replace` map, where the key is the vowel and the value is the vowel two letters ahead of it in the alphabet. \n\nThe twelfth line of the code uses the `transform` function to toggle the case of all the letters in the `message` string. The `transform` function takes three arguments: the beginning of the range to transform, the end of the range to transform, and a function that specifies how to transform each element in the range. In this case, the function checks if each character is uppercase using the `isupper` function. If it is, the function returns the lowercase version of the character using the `tolower` function. If it is not, the function returns the uppercase version of the character using the `toupper` function. \n\nThe thirteenth line of the code defines an empty string called `result` that will be used to store the encoded message. \n\nThe fourteenth line of the code uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the `message` string. For each character, the code checks if it is a vowel using the `count` function on the `vowels_replace` map. If it is, the code adds the corresponding value from the `vowels_replace` map to the `result` string. If it is not, the code adds the character to the `result` string. \n\nThe fifteenth line of the code returns the `result` string, which contains the encoded message. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function encode(message)\n"

The function is called `words_string`. \n\nThe function definition starts with the return type `std::vector<std::string>`, which means that the function returns a vector of strings. The function name is `words_string`, and it takes a single argument, which is a string `s`.\n\nThe first line inside the function is `std::vector<std::string> result;`. This creates an empty vector of strings called `result`.\n\nThe next line is `std::replace(s.begin(), s.end(), ',', ' ');`. This replaces all commas in the input string `s` with spaces. The `std::replace` function takes three arguments: the beginning and end iterators of the range to search for the character to replace, and the character to replace it with.\n\nThe next line is `std::stringstream ss(s);`. This creates a stringstream object called `ss` initialized with the input string `s`.\n\nThe next line is `std::string word;`. This creates an empty string called `word`.\n\nThe next line is a while loop that reads words from the stringstream object `ss` and pushes them onto the `result` vector. The loop condition is `while (ss >> word)`, which means that the loop will continue as long as there are more words to read from the stringstream. Inside the loop, the current word is pushed onto the `result` vector using the `push_back` function.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector. \n\nThe purpose of this function is to split a string into individual words, where words are defined as sequences of characters separated by spaces or commas. The function achieves this by replacing commas with spaces, creating a stringstream object from the input string, and then reading words from the stringstream and pushing them onto a vector. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function words_string(s)\n"

The function is called `even_odd_palindrome` and is defined on lines 5-18.\n\nThe function first defines a lambda function `is_palindrome` on line 6 that takes in a single long integer `n` and returns a boolean value. The lambda function checks if the integer is a palindrome by converting it to a string, reversing the string, and then checking if the original string and the reversed string are equal. The lambda function is defined using the `auto` keyword, which allows the compiler to deduce the return type of the lambda function.\n\nThe function then initializes two long integers `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to 0 on lines 7-8.\n\nThe function then loops through all integers from 1 to `n` using a for loop on lines 9-16. For each integer `i`, the function checks if `i` is odd and a palindrome on line 10 using the modulo operator `%` to check if `i` is odd and the `is_palindrome` lambda function to check if `i` is a palindrome. If `i` is odd and a palindrome, the `odd_palindrome_count` variable is incremented on line 11. Similarly, if `i` is even and a palindrome, the `even_palindrome_count` variable is incremented on line 13.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` using the `std::make_tuple` function on line 17.\n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only the `vector` header is actually used in the code. The other headers are not necessary and can be removed.\n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function even_odd_palindrome(n)\n"

If the triangle is not valid, the function returns -1.\n\nThe next line calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is half the sum of the lengths of its sides. \n\nThe third line calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is a formula for finding the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. \n\nThe fourth line rounds the area to two decimal places. \n\nFinally, the function returns the area of the triangle. \n\nThe code uses the `cmath` library to calculate the square root of a number and the `bits/stdc++.h` library to include all standard libraries. \n\nThe code also includes the `assert.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` libraries, but they are not used in the function. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function triangle_area(a, b, c)\n"

This variable will keep track of the current state of the keys in the dictionary. \n\nThe function then iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary using a range-based for loop. \n\nFor each key, the function first checks if all characters in the key are alphabetic using the `std::all_of` function and the `::isalpha` function pointer. If not, it sets `state` to \"mixed\" and breaks out of the loop. \n\nIf the key is alphabetic, the function checks the current state of the keys. If the current state is \"start\", it checks if all characters in the key are uppercase or lowercase using `std::all_of` and `::isupper` or `::islower`, respectively. If all characters are uppercase, it sets `state` to \"upper\". If all characters are lowercase, it sets `state` to \"lower\". If the characters are mixed case, it breaks out of the loop. \n\nIf the current state is not \"start\", it checks if the current key is consistent with the current state (i.e., all uppercase if the state is \"upper\", all lowercase if the state is \"lower\"). If not, it sets `state` to \"mixed\" and breaks out of the loop. \n\nAfter iterating over all keys, the function returns true if the state is \"upper\" or \"lower\", indicating that all keys are in the same case, and false otherwise. \n\nNote that the code uses several C++ standard library headers (`<assert.h>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<vector>`, `<sstream>`, `<regex>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<unordered_map>`, and `<unordered_set>`), but not all of them are actually used in the function. \n\nAlso note that the code uses some C++11 features, such as range-based for loops and the `auto` keyword for type inference. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function check_dict_case(dict)\n"

The function is defined as follows:\n\n```c++\nstd::vector<long> tri(long n) {\n    // If n is 0, return a vector with a single element 1.\n    if (n == 0) {\n        return {1};\n    }\n    // Otherwise, initialize a vector with two elements 1 and 3.\n    std::vector<long> my_tri = {1, 3};\n    // Loop from 2 to n.\n    for (long i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {\n        // If i is even, push i/2 + 1 to the vector.\n        if (i % 2 == 0) {\n            my_tri.push_back(i / 2 + 1);\n        } else {\n            // Otherwise, push the sum of the last two elements of the vector\n            // and (i + 3)/2 to the vector.\n            my_tri.push_back(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2);\n        }\n    }\n    // Return the vector.\n    return my_tri;\n}\n```\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is 0. If it is, it returns a vector with a single element 1. Otherwise, it initializes a vector `my_tri` with two elements 1 and 3. It then loops from 2 to `n`. If the current index `i` is even, it pushes `i/2 + 1` to the vector. Otherwise, it pushes the sum of the last two elements of the vector and `(i + 3)/2` to the vector. Finally, it returns the vector.\n\nThe function generates a sequence of numbers called the \"triangular numbers\". The first few triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 666, 703, 741, 780, 820, 861, 903, 946, 990, 1035, 1081, 1128, 1176, 1225, 1275, 1326, 1378, 1431, 1485, 1540, 1596, 1653, 1711, 1770, 1830, 1891, 1953, 2016, 2080, 2145, 2211, 2278, 2346, 2415, 2485, 2556, 2628, 2701, 2775, 2850, 2926, 3003, 3081, 3160, 3240, 3321, 3403, 3486, 3570, 3655, 3741, 3828, 3916, 4005, 4095, 4186, 4278, 4371, 4465, 4560, 4656, 4753, 4851, 495\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function tri(n)\n"

The function is called `median` and takes a vector of long integers as input. \n\nThe first line of the function sorts the input vector using the `sort` function from the C++ standard library. \n\nThe second line of the function checks if the size of the vector is odd or even. If the size is odd, the function returns the middle element of the sorted vector. If the size is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements of the sorted vector. \n\nThe function returns a float value, which is the median of the input vector. \n\nThe code includes several header files that are used to import functions and classes from the C++ standard library. These header files are:\n\n- `assert.h`: provides a macro for debugging purposes that checks if a condition is true and terminates the program if it is not.\n- `bits/stdc++.h`: includes all standard header files in the C++ standard library. This is a non-standard header file that is not part of the C++ standard, but is supported by most compilers.\n- `vector`: provides a class template for dynamic arrays that can be resized at runtime.\n- `sstream`: provides classes and functions for working with string streams.\n- `regex`: provides classes and functions for working with regular expressions.\n- `map`: provides a class template for associative arrays that store key-value pairs.\n- `set`: provides a class template for sets, which are containers that store unique elements in sorted order. \n\nThe code does not use any external libraries or dependencies beyond the C++ standard library. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function median(l)\n"

It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 0. \n\nWithin the while loop, the function takes the remainder of `x` divided by `base` and converts it to a string using the `std::to_string` function. This string is then concatenated to the beginning of the `ret` string using the `+` operator. \n\nThe function then updates `x` to be the result of `x` divided by `base`. \n\nOnce the while loop has completed, the function returns the `ret` string, which represents the number `x` in the base `base`. \n\nThe code makes use of several C++ libraries, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, since these libraries are not used in the `change_base` function, they can be removed without affecting the functionality of the program. \n\nHere is the equivalent Lua code:\n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function change_base(x, base)\n"

The function checks if `b` is a cyclic pattern of `a`. A cyclic pattern is a pattern that can be obtained by shifting the characters of a string any number of times. For example, `abcabc` is a cyclic pattern of `abc`. \n\nThe function first calculates the length of the string `b` and then creates a pattern `pat` by concatenating `b` with itself. It then loops through all possible substrings of `a` of length `l` (the length of `b`) and checks if the substring is equal to any substring of `pat` of length `l`. If a match is found, the function returns `true`. If no match is found, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe code uses several C++ standard libraries including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `cycpattern_check` function. Therefore, they can be removed from the code without affecting its functionality. \n\n```lua\nfunction cycpattern_check(a, b)\n    local l = #b\n    local pat = b .. b\n    for i = 1, #a - l + 1 do\n        for j = 1, l do\n            if a:sub(i, i + l - 1) == pat:sub(j, j + l - 1) then\n                return true\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return false\nend\n```\n\nThe equivalent Lua code is shown above. The `#` operator is used to get the length of a string in Lua. The `string.sub` function is used to get a substring of a string. The `..` operator is used to concatenate two strings. The `return` statement is used to return a value from a function. The `if` statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code. The `for` loop is used to iterate over a range of values. The `local` keyword is used to declare local variables. \n\nNote that the Lua code does not include any of the standard libraries used in the C++ code. This is because the `cycpattern_check` function does not actually use any of these libraries. However, if the Lua code were to be used in a larger program that required these libraries, they would need to be included. \n\nOverall, the Lua code is a faithful translation of the C++ code that preserves the functionality of the `cycpattern_check` function while using Lua syntax and idioms.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function cycpattern_check(a, b)\n"

The function sorts the vector in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, and in descending order if the sum is even.\n\nThe function first checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, it returns an empty vector. Otherwise, it determines whether the vector should be sorted in ascending or descending order by checking the parity of the sum of the first and last elements. If the sum is even, the boolean variable `isReversed` is set to true, indicating that the vector should be sorted in descending order. Otherwise, `isReversed` is set to false, indicating that the vector should be sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe function then sorts the vector using the `std::sort` function, which takes in the vector's beginning and end iterators, as well as a lambda function that defines the sorting order. The lambda function compares two elements of the vector, `a` and `b`, and returns true if `a` should come before `b` in the sorted vector. If `isReversed` is true, the lambda function returns true if `a` is greater than `b`, indicating that the vector should be sorted in descending order. Otherwise, the lambda function returns true if `a` is less than `b`, indicating that the vector should be sorted in ascending order.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sorted vector. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function sort_array(array)\n"

The map contains the frequency of each word in the input string. The function also returns a map of the most frequent words in the input string.\n\nThe function starts by including several libraries that are used in the implementation. The libraries are `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. \n\nThe `histogram` function takes a string called `test` as input. It creates an empty map called `dict1` that will store the frequency of each word in the input string. It then creates a `stringstream` called `ss` from the input string. A `stringstream` is an object that allows you to read from a string as if it were a stream. \n\nThe function then enters a while loop that reads each word from the `stringstream` and updates the frequency of the word in the `dict1` map. If the frequency of the word is greater than the current maximum frequency `t`, `t` is updated to the new frequency. \n\nAfter the while loop, the function creates an empty map called `result` that will store the most frequent words in the input string. It then iterates over the `dict1` map and adds any words with a frequency equal to `t` to the `result` map.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` map. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function histogram(test)\n"

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. \n\nThe program defines a function called `get_odd_collatz` which takes a long integer `n` as input and returns a vector of long integers. The function is defined as follows:\n\n1. `std::vector<long> get_odd_collatz(long n) {` - This line defines the function `get_odd_collatz` which takes a long integer `n` as input and returns a vector of long integers.\n\n2. `std::vector<long> odd_collatz;` - This line defines an empty vector of long integers called `odd_collatz`.\n\n3. `if (n%2==0) {` - This line checks if `n` is even.\n\n4. `odd_collatz = {};` - If `n` is even, the vector `odd_collatz` is set to an empty vector.\n\n5. `} else {` - If `n` is odd, the following line is executed.\n\n6. `odd_collatz = {n};` - This line sets the vector `odd_collatz` to a vector containing only `n`.\n\n7. `while (n > 1) {` - This line starts a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1.\n\n8. `if (n % 2 == 0) {` - This line checks if `n` is even.\n\n9. `n = n/2;` - If `n` is even, `n` is divided by 2.\n\n10. `} else {` - If `n` is odd, the following line is executed.\n\n11. `n = n*3 + 1;` - This line sets `n` to `n` multiplied by 3 plus 1.\n\n12. `if (n%2 == 1) {` - This line checks if `n` is odd.\n\n13. `odd_collatz.push_back(n);` - If `n` is odd, `n` is added to the end of the `odd_collatz` vector.\n\n14. `}` - End of the if statement.\n\n15. `}` - End of the while loop.\n\n16. `std::sort(odd_collatz.begin(), odd_collatz.end());` - This line sorts the `odd_collatz` vector in ascending order.\n\n17. `return odd_collatz;` - This line returns the `odd_collatz` vector.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function get_odd_collatz(n)\n"

For each element `xs[i]`, the function computes `i * xs[i]` and appends the result to the `res` vector. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` vector which contains the result of the computation. \n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are used to include various libraries that are used in the code. The `assert.h` library is used to include the `assert` function which is used to check if a condition is true and terminate the program if it is not. The `bits/stdc++.h` library is a header file that includes all standard libraries in C++. The `vector` library is used to define and manipulate vectors. The `sstream` library is used for string stream processing. The `regex` library is used for regular expression processing. The `map` library is used to define and manipulate maps. The `set` library is used to define and manipulate sets. \n\nThe `int` keyword is used to define a variable as an integer. The `long` keyword is used to define a variable as a long integer. The `std` namespace is used to specify that the function `derivative` belongs to the standard namespace. \n\nThe `++` operator is used to increment the value of a variable by 1. The `push_back` function is used to append an element to the end of a vector. The `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function derivative(xs)\n"

The function returns a vector of strings that contains all the words in `s` that have exactly `n` consonants. \n\nThe function starts by creating an empty vector of strings called `result`. It then creates a stringstream object called `ss` that is initialized with the string `s`. This object is used to extract words from `s` one by one. \n\nThe function then enters a while loop that runs as long as there are still words to be extracted from `ss`. In each iteration of the loop, the function extracts the next word from `ss` and stores it in a string variable called `word`. \n\nThe function then counts the number of consonants in `word` by iterating over each character in `word` and checking if it is a consonant. If a character is a consonant, the function increments a counter called `n_consonants`. \n\nIf `n_consonants` is equal to `n`, the function adds `word` to the `result` vector. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector. \n\nThe code includes several header files that provide access to various C++ libraries. These header files are:\n\n- `assert.h`: provides a macro called `assert` that can be used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the program terminates with an error message. \n- `bits/stdc++.h`: includes all the standard C++ headers. \n- `vector`: provides the vector container class. \n- `sstream`: provides the stringstream class, which can be used to extract values from strings. \n- `regex`: provides support for regular expressions. \n- `map`: provides the map container class, which stores key-value pairs. \n- `set`: provides the set container class, which stores unique elements in sorted order. \n- `unordered_map`: provides the unordered_map container class, which stores key-value pairs in an unordered manner. \n- `unordered_set`: provides the unordered_set container class, which stores unique elements in an unordered manner. \n\nNote that not all of these header files are actually used in the code. \n\nThe `std::string::npos` constant is used to check if a character is not a vowel. `std::string::npos` is a special value that represents the end of a string. If the `find` method of a string object returns `std::string::npos`, it means that the substring being searched for was not found in the string. In this case, it means that the character being checked is not a vowel. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function select_words(s, n)\n"

The function calculates the number of odd elements in each string of the input vector and returns a string that describes the result.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` library, which provides a macro called `assert` that can be used to check if a condition is true. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` library, which is a header file that includes all standard libraries in C++. This is not a recommended practice as it can slow down the compilation time and increase the size of the executable file. The third line declares a vector of strings called `std::vector<std::string> res;` which will store the output of the function. The fourth line starts a for loop that iterates over each string in the input vector `lst`. The fifth line declares an integer variable `n` and assigns it the value of the number of odd elements in the current string. The `std::count_if` function is used to count the number of elements in the string that satisfy a certain condition. In this case, the condition is that the character is odd, which is checked by the lambda function `[](char c){return c%2==1;}`. The sixth line constructs a string that describes the result of the calculation and appends it to the output vector `res`. The string is constructed using the `std::to_string` function, which converts an integer to a string. The string contains the number of odd elements in the string, the index of the string in the input vector, and the length of the input vector. The seventh line closes the for loop. The eighth line returns the output vector `res`. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function odd_count(lst)\n"

If the vector has less than two elements, the function returns `std::nullopt`, which is a C++11 feature that represents a null optional value.\n\nThe function first sorts the input vector using `std::sort`, which is a built-in C++ function that sorts a range of elements in ascending order. The function then removes all duplicates from the vector using `std::unique`, which is another built-in C++ function that removes consecutive duplicates from a range of elements. The function then returns the second element of the resulting vector using `std::make_optional`, which is a C++17 feature that creates an optional value from a given value.\n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the code are preprocessor directives that include various C++ standard library headers, such as `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`.

The `bits/stdc++.h` header is a non-standard header that includes all standard C++ headers, which is a convenient way to include all necessary headers in a single line. The `vector` header provides the `std::vector` class, which is a dynamic array that can be resized at runtime. The `sstream` header provides the `std::stringstream` class, which is used to convert between strings and other data types. The `regex` header provides the `std::regex` class, which is used to perform regular expression matching. The `map` header provides the `std::map` class, which is an associative container that stores key-value pairs in sorted order. The `set` header provides the `std::set` class, which is an associative container that stores unique elements in sorted order.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function next_smallest(lst)\n"

The function returns a long integer.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` library.

A map is an associative array that stores key-value pairs.\n\nThe seventh line of the code declares a set data type. A set is a container that stores unique elements.\n\nThe `choose_num` function checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, the function returns -1. If `y` is even, the function returns `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns `y-1`. \n\nThe function is used to choose a number between `x` and `y` based on certain conditions. If the conditions are not met, the function returns -1. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function choose_num(x, y)\n"

The function calculates the running maximum of the input vector. \n\nThe function starts by creating an empty vector called `result` to store the running maximums. It then initializes a variable called `running_max` to 0. \n\nThe function then loops through each element `n` in the input vector. For each element, it updates the `running_max` variable to be the maximum of the current `running_max` and the current element `n`. It then appends the updated `running_max` to the `result` vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector containing the running maximums.\n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, only the `vector` header is actually used in the implementation of the `rolling_max` function. \n\nThe `bits/stdc++.h` header is a non-standard header that includes all other standard headers. This header is not recommended for use in production code as it can lead to slower compile times and potential naming conflicts. \n\nOverall, the `rolling_max` function is a simple and efficient implementation of a common algorithm. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function rolling_max(numbers)\n"

The function is defined in the following way:\n\n```C++\nstd::string words_in_sentence(std::string sentence) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe function takes in a string called `sentence` and returns a string. The function is defined in the following way:\n\n```C++\nstd::vector<std::string> new_lst;\nstd::stringstream ss(sentence);\nstd::string word;\nwhile(ss >> word) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe function first initializes an empty vector called `new_lst`. It then creates a `stringstream` object called `ss` that is initialized with the `sentence` string. It then initializes an empty string called `word`. It then enters a while loop that reads the `ss` stream word by word and stores each word in the `word` variable. The loop continues until there are no more words to read.\n\n```C++\nint flg = 0;\nif(word.size() == 1) {\n    flg = 1;\n}\nfor(int i = 2; i < word.size(); i++) {\n    if(word.size()%i == 0) {\n        flg = 1;\n    }\n}\nif(flg == 0 || word.size() == 2) {\n    new_lst.push_back(word);\n}\n```\n\nFor each word, the function initializes an integer variable called `flg` to 0. It then checks if the length of the word is 1. If it is, it sets `flg` to 1. It then enters a for loop that checks if the length of the word is divisible by any number greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it sets `flg` to 1. If `flg` is 0 or the length of the word is 2, it adds the word to the `new_lst` vector.\n\n```C++\nstd::string res = \"\";\nfor(int i = 0; i < new_lst.size(); i++) {\n    res += new_lst[i];\n    if(i != new_lst.size()-1) {\n        res += \" \";\n    }\n}\nreturn res;\n```\n\nFinally, the function initializes an empty string called `res`. It then enters a for loop that iterates over each word in the `new_lst` vector and appends it to the `res` string. If the word is not the last word in the vector, it also appends a space character to the `res` string. Finally, the function returns the `res` string.\n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function words_in_sentence(sentence)\n"

The function calculates the absolute difference between each element of the two input vectors and returns a vector of the same length as the input vectors with the absolute differences as elements.\n\nThe first line of the code includes the `assert.h` header file, which provides a macro called `assert` that can be used to check if a condition is true. The second line includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header file, which includes all the standard C++ headers. This is a non-standard header file that is not part of the C++ standard library, but is supported by most compilers.\n\nThe third line declares a vector of long integers called `res`. The fourth line starts a for loop that iterates over the elements of the `game` vector. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the size of the `game` vector. The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.\n\nInside the loop, the absolute difference between the `i`th element of the `game` vector and the `i`th element of the `guess` vector is calculated using the `abs` function. The result is pushed onto the `res` vector using the `push_back` method.\n\nFinally, the `res` vector is returned from the function. \n\nThe function can be rewritten in Lua as follows:\n\n```lua\nfunction compare(game, guess)\n    local res = {}\n    for i=1,#game do\n        table.insert(res, math.abs(game[i] - guess[i]))\n    end\n    return res\nend\n```\n\n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function compare(game, guess)\n"

The function returns true if the two strings have the same set of characters, and false otherwise. \n\nThe function is defined with the following signature: `bool same_chars(std::string s0, std::string s1)`. It takes two arguments, both of which are of type `std::string`. The function returns a boolean value.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code: `return std::set<char>(s0.begin(), s0.end()) == std::set<char>(s1.begin(), s1.end());`. This line of code creates two `std::set<char>` objects, one for each input string. The `std::set` container is used to store unique elements in sorted order. In this case, the `std::set` is used to store the unique characters in each input string. \n\nThe `std::set` constructor takes two iterators as arguments, which specify the range of elements to be inserted into the set. In this case, the `begin()` and `end()` member functions of the `std::string` class are used to obtain iterators that specify the range of characters in each input string. \n\nThe `==` operator is then used to compare the two `std::set` objects. If the two sets are equal, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. \n\nThe `#include` directive at the beginning of the code imports the `assert.h` and `bits/stdc++.h` header files. The former provides the `assert()` function, which is used to check if a condition is true and terminate the program if it is not. The latter is a convenience header file that includes most of the standard library headers. \n\nThe `#include` directive for `vector` is not needed, as it is not used in the code. \n\nThe `#include` directive for `sstream` is not needed, as it is not used in the code. \n\nThe `#include` directive for `regex` is not needed, as it is not used in the code. \n\nThe `#include` directive for `map` is not needed, as it is not used in the code. \n\nThe `#include` directive for `set` is needed, as it is used in the code. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that checks if two strings have the same set of characters. It uses the `std::set` container to store the unique characters in each string and compares the two sets to determine if they are equal. The code is written in a concise and efficient manner, and does not require any external libraries or complex algorithms. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function same_chars(s0, s1)\n"

The first integer is the count of even digits in the input integer and the second integer is the count of odd digits in the input integer.\n\nThe function is defined with the name `even_odd_count` and takes an integer `num` as input. The function returns a tuple of two integers, both of type `long`. \n\nThe function first initializes two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` to 0. \n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the string representation of the absolute value of the input integer. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the input integer is positive. \n\nFor each character, the function checks if it is even or odd. This is done by converting the character to an integer using `int(i)` and then checking if the integer is divisible by 2. If the integer is divisible by 2, then the character is even and the `even_count` variable is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the character is odd and the `odd_count` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of the `even_count` and `odd_count` variables using the `std::make_tuple` function. \n\nThe function makes use of several C++ standard library functions and headers. The `assert.h` header is used to include the `assert` function, which is not used in the code. The `bits/stdc++.h` header is a non-standard header that includes all standard headers. The `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` headers are included but not used in the code. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function even_odd_count(num)\n"

The loop uses the `>>` operator to extract words from the `stringstream` object. The extracted word is stored in the string variable `word`.\n\nThe loop then checks if the extracted word is a number. It does this by using the `std::regex_match` function to match the word against a regular expression that matches one or more digits. If the word is a number, it is converted to an integer using the `std::stoi` function and added to the vector `lis`.\n\nAfter all the words have been extracted from the `stringstream` object, the function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of all integers in the vector `lis`. This is done using the `std::accumulate` function, which sums up all the elements in the vector. The result is subtracted from `n` and returned as the final result of the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function fruit_distribution(s, n)\n"

The function is defined on lines 6-12. \n\nThe function takes two strings `a` and `b` as input. It then iterates over each character in the string `a` and compares it to the corresponding character in the string `b`. If the characters are the same, it appends a '0' to the answer string. If the characters are different, it appends a '1' to the answer string.

It then loops from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and for each iteration, it appends the string representation of the current iteration number to `result`. If the current iteration number is not equal to `n`, it also appends a space character to `result`. Finally, it returns the resulting string.\n\nThe function essentially generates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and concatenates them into a single string separated by spaces. For example, if `n` is `3`, the function would return the string `\"0 1 2 3\"`. \n\nThe code makes use of several C++ standard library headers including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` are actually used in the implementation of the function. The `assert.h` header is likely included for debugging purposes, while `bits/stdc++.h` is a non-standard header that includes all other standard headers and is often used for convenience. \n\nOverall, the function is relatively simple and can be easily translated to Lua. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function string_sequence(n)\n"

The function checks if the input string is a valid file name. The function returns \"Yes\" if the file name is valid and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe function first creates a vector of strings called `suf` that contains three file extensions: \"txt\", \"exe\", and \"dll\". \n\nThe function then creates an empty vector of strings called `lst` and a stringstream object called `ss` that is initialized with the input string `file_name`. The stringstream object is used to split the input string into two parts: the file name and the file extension. The `while` loop reads the input string `file_name` and splits it into two parts using the delimiter \".\". The two parts are then added to the vector `lst`.\n\nThe function then checks if the vector `lst` has exactly two elements. If it does not, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function then checks if the second element of the vector `lst` is one of the file extensions in the vector `suf`. If it is not, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function then checks if the first element of the vector `lst` is not empty and starts with an alphabet. If it is empty or does not start with an alphabet, the function returns \"No\".\n\nThe function then counts the number of digits in the first element of the vector `lst`. If the number of digits is greater than 3, the function returns \"No\".\n\nFinally, if all the above conditions are satisfied, the function returns \"Yes\". \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function file_name_check(file_name)\n"

If the condition is false, the program will terminate with an error message. \n\n`<bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file that includes all the standard C++ libraries. \n\n`<vector>` is a header file that provides the `vector` container class, which is used to store a dynamic array of elements. \n\n`<sstream>` is a header file that provides the `stringstream` class, which is used to manipulate strings. \n\n`<regex>` is a header file that provides the `regex` class, which is used to perform regular expression matching. \n\n`<map>` is a header file that provides the `map` container class, which is used to store key-value pairs. \n\n`<set>` is a header file that provides the `set` container class, which is used to store a set of unique elements. \n\nThe `std::` prefix before each of these header files indicates that the functions and classes they provide are part of the standard C++ library. \n\nThe `std::vector<long>` in the function signature indicates that the function takes in a vector of long integers as an argument and returns a vector of long integers. \n\nThe `auto` keyword in the for loop is used to automatically deduce the type of the iterator variable `n`. \n\nThe `++n` in the for loop is equivalent to `n = n + 1` and is used to increment the iterator variable `n`. \n\nThe `*n` in the for loop is used to dereference the iterator variable `n` and get the value it points to. \n\nThe `push_back` method of the `vector` class is used to add an element to the end of the vector. \n\nThe `back` method of the `vector` class is used to get the last element of the vector. \n\nThe `return {}` statement is used to return an empty vector. \n\nOverall, the code is a simple implementation of a function that intersperses a delimiter between elements of a vector. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function intersperse(numbers, delimeter)\n"

The function checks if the two strings can be concatenated in any order to form a string with balanced parentheses. If the parentheses are balanced, the function returns \"Yes\", otherwise it returns \"No\".\n\nThe function first defines a lambda function called `check` that takes in a string and returns a boolean. The lambda function checks if the string has balanced parentheses by iterating through each character of the string and keeping track of the number of open and closed parentheses. If the number of closed parentheses is ever greater than the number of open parentheses, the function returns false. If the number of open and closed parentheses are equal at the end of the iteration, the function returns true.\n\nThe function then concatenates the two input strings in two different orders and stores them in variables `S1` and `S2`. It then checks if either `S1` or `S2` has balanced parentheses by calling the `check` lambda function on each string. If either string has balanced parentheses, the function returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, it returns \"No\". \n\nThe function uses several C++ standard libraries including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, none of these libraries are actually used in the implementation of the `match_parens` function. Therefore, they can be removed from the code without affecting the functionality of the program. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function match_parens(lst)\n"

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` returns `true` if `n` is an even number greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe function is defined using the `bool` keyword, which specifies that the function returns a boolean value. The function takes in a single argument, `n`, which is a long integer.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions. The first condition checks if `n` is even, which is done by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is 0. The second condition checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8.\n\nIf both conditions are true, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe `#include` directive at the beginning of the code imports the `assert.h` header file, which provides the `assert` function for debugging purposes. The `bits/stdc++.h` header file includes all standard C++ headers, making it easier to write concise code. The `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` headers are also included, although they are not used in this particular function. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a boolean check for even numbers greater than or equal to 8. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_equal_to_sum_even(n)\n"

The function checks if the two fractions represented by the input strings are equivalent, and returns true if they are, and false otherwise.\n\nThe function first creates two string stream objects, `ss1` and `ss2`, from the input strings `x` and `n`, respectively. It then extracts the numerator and denominator of each fraction from the string streams using the `>>` operator, and stores them in the integer variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The `slash` character is used to separate the numerator and denominator in the input strings.\n\nThe function then computes the product of the numerators and denominators of the two fractions, and stores them in the integer variables `numerator` and `denom`, respectively. It then checks if the remainder of the division of `numerator` by `denom` is zero, and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.\n\nThe code uses several C++ standard library headers, including `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, and `unordered_set`. However, only the `sstream` header is actually used in the implementation of the `simplify` function.

If it is uppercase, the function converts it to lowercase using the `tolower` function. If it is lowercase, the function converts it to uppercase using the `toupper` function. The function then sets the corresponding character in the `new_str` string to the converted character and sets the `flg` variable to true. \n\nAfter the loop, the function checks if the `flg` variable is still false. If it is false, it means that there were no alphabets in the original string `s`.

If the vector is monotonic, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nThe function first includes the header file `assert.h`, which provides a macro called `assert`. This macro is used to check if a condition is true and if it is not, the program will terminate. However, in this code, the `assert` macro is not used.\n\nThe function also includes the header file `bits/stdc++.h`, which is a shortcut to include all the standard C++ headers. This is not a recommended practice as it can lead to longer compile times and potential naming conflicts.\n\nThe function then creates a vector of long integers called `l` from the input parameter. The function then calls the `is_sorted` function from the standard library twice to check if the vector is monotonic. The first call checks if the vector is non-decreasing, and the second call checks if the vector is non-increasing. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nThe function then ends. There are no global variables or side effects. The function is self-contained and can be easily reused in other programs.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function monotonic(l)\n"

The function checks if the input integer is a perfect cube or not. \n\nThe function first takes the absolute value of the input integer using the `abs` function. This is done to ensure that the function works correctly for negative integers as well. \n\nThe function then calculates the cube root of the input integer using the `pow` function. The `pow` function is used to calculate the cube root because the `sqrt` function only works for square roots. The `round` function is used to round the result of the cube root calculation to the nearest integer. \n\nThe rounded cube root is then cubed using the `pow` function again, and the result is compared to the original input integer.

The function returns a tuple of two values, a string and a boolean. The string is the result of deleting all characters in `s` that are also in `c`. The boolean is true if the resulting string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.\n\nThe function first uses the `std::remove_if` algorithm to remove all characters in `s` that are also in `c`. The `std::remove_if` algorithm takes two iterators that define a range of elements to process, and a predicate function that returns true for elements to be removed. In this case, the predicate function is a lambda that captures the `c` string by reference, and returns true if the character is found in `c`.\n\nAfter removing the characters, the function constructs a new string from the remaining characters using the `std::string` constructor that takes two iterators defining a range of elements. The range is constructed using the `s.rbegin()` and `s.rend()` iterators, which define a reverse range of elements. This constructs a new string that is the reverse of the original string.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of the new string and a boolean that is true if the new string is equal to the original string (i.e., if the new string is a palindrome). The tuple is constructed using the `std::make_tuple` function, which takes any number of arguments and returns a tuple of those arguments. In this case, the arguments are the new string and the boolean value.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function reverse_delete(s, c)\n"

The function takes a string of brackets as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets are balanced or not.\n\nThe function is defined with the name `correct_bracketing` and takes a single argument of type `std::string`.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `depth` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the current depth of the bracketing.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the input string using a range-based for loop. For each character, the function checks if it is an opening bracket (`<`). If it is, the depth is incremented by 1. If it is a closing bracket (`>`), the depth is decremented by 1. If the depth ever becomes negative, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and the function returns `false`.\n\nAfter iterating over all the characters in the input string, the function checks if the depth is equal to 0. If it is, it means that the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function uses the `std::string` type from the C++ standard library to represent the input string. It also uses the `bool` type to represent the return value.\n\nThe function uses the `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set` headers from the C++ standard library. However, only the `assert.h` header is actually used in the function. The other headers are not needed and can be removed.\n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a common problem in computer science, and can be easily translated to other programming languages such as Lua. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function correct_bracketing(brackets)\n"

The function first creates a regular expression object `r` that matches any of the characters `.`, `?`, and `!` followed by zero or more whitespace characters. \n\nThe function then creates a vector of strings called `sentences` by using the `std::sregex_token_iterator` function to split the input string `S` into substrings using the regular expression `r`. The `std::sregex_token_iterator` function is called with four arguments: the first two arguments are iterators that specify the range of characters to search for matches in (in this case, the entire input string `S`), the third argument is the regular expression object `r`, and the fourth argument is an integer that specifies how many times to split the input string (in this case, `-1` means to split the string as many times as possible).\n\nThe function then initializes a long integer variable `res` to zero, and loops over each sentence in the `sentences` vector. For each sentence, the function checks if the first two characters are equal to the string `\"I \"`, and if so, increments the `res` variable by one.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `res` variable, which represents the number of sentences in the input string `S` that begin with the string `\"I \"`. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_bored(S)\n"

If there is no such integer, the function returns -1.\n\nThe function starts by creating a vector called `frq` that is initialized with zeros and has a size equal to the maximum element in the input vector plus one. This vector will be used to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the input vector.\n\n```std::vector<long> frq(*std::max_element(lst.begin(), lst.end()) + 1, 0);```\n\nThe `std::max_element` function returns an iterator to the maximum element in the input vector. The `*` operator is used to dereference the iterator and get the actual value of the maximum element. This value is then added to 1 to get the size of the `frq` vector. The `0` argument is used to initialize all elements of the `frq` vector to zero.\n\nThe function then loops through the input vector and updates the frequency of each integer in the `frq` vector.\n\n```for (auto i : lst) {\n        frq[i]++;\n    }```\n\nThe `auto` keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of the loop variable `i`. In this case, `i` will be of type `long` since the input vector is a vector of `long`s.\n\nAfter updating the frequency of each integer in the `frq` vector, the function loops through the `frq` vector and checks if the frequency of each integer is greater than or equal to its value. If it is, then that integer is a candidate for the smallest integer that occurs at least as many times as its value. The function keeps track of the smallest such integer found so far and returns it at the end of the loop.\n\n```long ans = -1;\n    for (int i = 1; i < frq.size(); i++) {\n        if (frq[i] >= i) {\n            ans = i;\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;```\n\nThe `ans` variable is initialized to -1, which will be returned if no integer is found that occurs at least as many times as its value. The loop starts at index 1 of the `frq` vector because the frequency of the integer 0 is not relevant to the problem. The loop checks if the frequency of the integer at index `i` is greater than or equal to `i`. If it is, then `i` is a candidate for the smallest integer that occurs at least as many times as its value. The loop keeps track of the smallest such integer found so far in the `ans` variable. Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function search(lst)\n"

If the input array is empty or contains no even integers, the function returns an empty array.\n\nThe function is defined to take in a `std::vector<long>` called `arr` and returns a `std::vector<long>`. The first line of the function checks if the input array is empty and returns an empty array if it is. \n\nThe second line of the function creates an empty vector called `evens`. The third line of the function loops through each element `x` in the input array `arr` and checks if `x` is even (i.e., if `x%2 == 0`). If `x` is even, it is appended to the `evens` vector.\n\nThe fourth line of the function checks if the `evens` vector is empty and returns an empty array if it is. \n\nThe fifth line of the function finds the minimum element in the `evens` vector using the `std::min_element` function from the `<algorithm>` library. The minimum value is stored in a variable called `min_val`.\n\nThe sixth line of the function finds the index of the minimum value in the input array using the `std::find` function from the `<algorithm>` library. The index is calculated by subtracting the beginning of the input array from the iterator returned by `std::find`. The result is stored in a variable called `min_index`.\n\nThe function returns a vector containing `min_val` and `min_index`. \n\nThe code uses several C++ libraries including `<assert.h>`, `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<vector>`, `<sstream>`, `<regex>`, `<map>`, and `<set>`. However, none of these libraries are used in the implementation of the `pluck` function. Therefore, they can be removed from the code without affecting the functionality of the `pluck` function. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function pluck(arr)\n"

The outer loop iterates over all elements of the vector, while the inner loop iterates over all elements of the vector that come after the current element being iterated over by the outer loop. This ensures that each pair of elements is only checked once.\n\nThe loop checks if the sum of the current pair of elements is equal to zero. If it is, the function returns `true`. If no pairs are found that sum to zero, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe function makes use of the following C++ standard library headers: `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. However, only `vector` is actually used in the implementation of the function. The other headers are likely included for other parts of the program that are not shown in this code snippet. \n\nThe `bits/stdc++.h` header is a non-standard header that includes all standard C++ headers. It is often used in competitive programming to save time when including multiple headers. However, it is not recommended for use in production code.\n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a common programming problem and could be easily rewritten in Lua. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function pairs_sum_to_zero(l)\n"

If it is, the function returns 1. \n\nIf `n` is not equal to 1, the function returns the result of the expression `18 * pow(10, n - 2)`. \n\nThe `pow` function is used to raise 10 to the power of `n-2`. This is because the number of integers that start with 1 and end with `n` digits is 9 * 10^(n-1). However, we are only interested in the numbers that start with 1, so we need to subtract the number of integers that start with 1 and have `n-1` digits, which is 10^(n-2). \n\nThe `18` in the expression is because each of the remaining digits can be any of the 9 digits from 0 to 9, except for 1, which is already used as the first digit. Therefore, there are 9 choices for each of the remaining `n-1` digits, giving a total of 9^(n-1) possible numbers. However, we are only interested in the numbers that end with `n`, so we need to divide by 10, which gives us 9^(n-2). Multiplying this by 2 gives us 18, which is the coefficient of the `pow` expression. \n\nThe `long` data type is used to ensure that the function can handle large integers. \n\nThe `#include` statements at the beginning of the program are used to include various libraries that are needed for the program to run. These libraries include `assert.h`, `bits/stdc++.h`, `vector`, `sstream`, `regex`, `map`, and `set`. \n\nThe `assert.h` library is used to include the `assert` function, which is used to check if an expression is true. \n\nThe `bits/stdc++.h` library is a shortcut that includes all the standard libraries in C++. \n\nThe `vector` library is used to define the `vector` data type, which is a dynamic array that can be resized at runtime. \n\nThe `sstream` library is used to define the `stringstream` data type, which is used to convert strings to other data types. \n\nThe `regex` library is used to define regular expressions, which are patterns used to match strings. \n\nThe `map` library is used to define the `map` data type, which is an associative array that maps keys to values. \n\nThe `set` library is used to define the `set` data type, which is a collection of unique elements.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function starts_one_ends(n)\n"

The function checks if the string has at least two nested square brackets. \n\nThe function starts by declaring two vectors of integers called `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`. These vectors will be used to store the indices of opening and closing brackets in the string. \n\nThe function then loops through the string character by character using a for loop. If the current character is an opening bracket, its index is added to the `opening_bracket_index` vector. If the current character is a closing bracket, its index is added to the `closing_bracket_index` vector. \n\nAfter the loop, the `closing_bracket_index` vector is reversed using the `std::reverse` function. This is because we want to check the brackets from the inside out, and reversing the vector allows us to do that easily. \n\nThe function then declares three integer variables called `cnt`, `i`, and `l`. `cnt` will be used to keep track of the number of nested brackets, `i` will be used as an index for the `closing_bracket_index` vector, and `l` is the size of the `closing_bracket_index` vector. \n\nThe function then loops through the `opening_bracket_index` vector using a for loop. For each index in the `opening_bracket_index` vector, the function checks if there is a corresponding closing bracket that comes after it. If there is, `cnt` is incremented and `i` is also incremented to move to the next closing bracket. \n\nFinally, the function returns `true` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, which means that there are at least two nested brackets in the string. Otherwise, it returns `false`. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_nested(string)\n"

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, \"racecar\" is a palindrome, but \"hello\" is not.\n\nThe function is called `is_palindrome` and takes a single argument, a string called `text`. The function returns a boolean value, `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function first defines a for loop that iterates over the characters in the string. The loop starts at the first character (index 0) and continues until the last character (index `text.size() - 1`). The `text.size()` function returns the length of the string.\n\nInside the loop, the function checks whether the character at the current index is equal to the character at the corresponding index from the end of the string. If the characters are not equal, the function immediately returns `false`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any unequal characters, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.\n\nThe function does not modify the input string in any way.\n\nThe code includes several header files, which provide additional functionality to the program. The `assert.h` header provides the `assert` macro, which can be used to check whether a condition is true and terminate the program if it is not. The `bits/stdc++.h` header is a shortcut that includes most of the standard C++ headers. The `vector` header provides the `vector` container class, which is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. The `sstream` header provides the `stringstream` class, which can be used to convert between strings and other data types. The `regex` header provides regular expression functionality. The `map` header provides the `map` container class, which is an associative array that maps keys to values. The `set` header provides the `set` container class, which is a collection of unique elements. However, none of these headers are actually used in the `is_palindrome` function, so they could be removed without affecting the functionality of the program.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_palindrome(text)\n"

It then loops from `i=1` to `n` (inclusive) and pushes the value `i^2 - i + 1` to the end of the vector `A`. \n\nThe function then initializes a variable called `ans` of type `long` to `0`.

The function sorts each word in the input string alphabetically and concatenates them with spaces in between. The output string is the sorted version of the input string.\n\nThe function uses the following libraries:\n- `assert.h`: A header file that provides a macro called `assert` that can be used to check if an expression is true. If the expression is false, the program will terminate with an error message.\n- `bits/stdc++.h`: A header file that includes all the standard C++ libraries.\n- `vector`: A container that stores a dynamic array of elements.\n- `sstream`: A header file that provides classes for working with strings as streams of characters.\n- `regex`: A header file that provides classes for working with regular expressions.\n- `map`: A container that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the keys.\n- `set`: A container that stores unique elements in a sorted order.\n\nThe function first creates a `stringstream` object `ss` from the input string `s`. It then initializes two strings `word` and `res` to empty strings. The `while` loop reads each word from the `stringstream` object `ss` and sorts it alphabetically using the `std::sort` function. The sorted word is then concatenated with a space to the `res` string. The `pop_back` function is then used to remove the trailing space from the `res` string. Finally, the sorted string is returned.\n\nThe `std::sort` function is a built-in function in C++ that sorts a range of elements in ascending order. It takes two iterators that define the range to be sorted and an optional comparison function that defines the order of the elements. In this case, the default comparison function is used, which sorts the elements in ascending order based on their values. \n\nThe function can be rewritten in Lua as follows:\n\n```lua\nfunction anti_shuffle(s)\n    local res = \"\"\n    for word in s:gmatch(\"%S+\") do\n        local sorted_word = table.concat({word:byte(1, -1)}, \"\")\n        table.sort(sorted_word)\n        res = res .. sorted_word .. \" \"\n    end\n    return res:sub(1, -2)\nend\n```\n\nThe Lua function uses the `string.gmatch` function to iterate over each word in the input string `s`. The `%S+` pattern matches one or more non-space characters. The `table.concat` function is used to convert the characters in the word to a table of ASCII codes, which is then sorted using the `table.sort` function. The sorted table is then concatenated with a space to the `res` string. The `string.sub` function is used to remove the trailing space from the `res` string before returning it. \n\nNote that the C++ function sorts the words in place, while the Lua function creates a new table to store the sorted characters. This is because Lua strings are immutable, so it is not possible to sort the characters in place. Also, the C++ function uses a `stringstream` object to read the words from the input string, while the Lua function uses the `string.gmatch` function to iterate over the words. Finally, the C++ function returns the sorted string, while the Lua function returns the sorted words concatenated with spaces. These differences are due to the different data structures and functions available in the two languages.<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function anti_shuffle(s)\n"

The function takes in a 2D vector of long integers `grid` and a long integer `k` as its arguments and returns a vector of long integers `ans`. \n\nThe function first initializes a variable `n` to the size of the input grid. It then initializes a variable `val` to `n * n + 1`. \n\nThe function then iterates through each element of the input grid using two nested for loops. For each element of the grid, if the element is equal to 1, the function creates an empty vector `temp`. It then checks if the current element is not in the first row of the grid and if it is not, it appends the element above it to the `temp` vector. It then checks if the current element is not in the first column of the grid and if it is not, it appends the element to the left of it to the `temp` vector. It then checks if the current element is not in the last row of the grid and if it is not, it appends the element below it to the `temp` vector. It then checks if the current element is not in the last column of the grid and if it is not, it appends the element to the right of it to the `temp` vector. \n\nThe function then sets the value of `val` to the minimum value in the `temp` vector. \n\nThe function then initializes an empty vector `ans`. It then iterates `k` times. For each iteration, if the current iteration is even, it appends the value 1 to the `ans` vector. If the current iteration is odd, it appends the value of `val` to the `ans` vector. \n\nFinally, the function returns the `ans` vector. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function minPath(grid, k)\n"

The cipher shifts each letter two positions to the right in the alphabet. For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'b' becomes 'd', and so on. The function uses the `find` method of the string `d` to get the index of the character in the alphabet, adds 4 to it (2*2), takes the result modulo 26 to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the alphabet, and uses the resulting index to get the encrypted character from `d`. The encrypted character is then appended to the `out` string.\n\n```out += d[(d.find(c)+2*2) % 26];```\n\nIf the character is not a lowercase letter, it is simply appended to the `out` string without being encrypted.\n\n```} else {\n    out += c;\n}```\n\nFinally, the function returns the encrypted string.\n\n```return out;```<|im_end|>\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function encrypt(s)\n"

It takes a single argument, `n`, which is a long integer. The function returns a boolean value, `true` if `n` is prime, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function first checks if `n` is less than 2. If it is, then it returns `false`, since 2 is the smallest prime number. This is done using the `if` statement: `if (n < 2) { return false; }`.\n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 2, then the function enters a `for` loop that iterates over all integers `k` from 2 to `n-1`. This is done using the `for` loop: `for (long k = 2; k < n; k++) { ... }`.\n\nFor each value of `k`, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `k`. If it is, then `n` is not prime, and the function returns `false`. This is done using the `if` statement: `if (n % k == 0) { return false; }`.\n\nIf the `for` loop completes without finding a value of `k` that divides `n`, then `n` is prime, and the function returns `true`. This is done using the `return` statement: `return true;`.\n\nThe code also includes several header files (`#include<assert.h>`, `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`, `#include<vector>`, `#include<sstream>`, `#include<regex>`, `#include<map>`, and `#include<set>`), but these are not directly related to the implementation of the `is_prime` function, and are likely included for other parts of the program. \n\nFinally, the code does not include a `main` function, so it cannot be run as a standalone program. It is likely intended to be included as part of a larger program. \n\n\n### Lua version\n\nmath = require('math')\nlocal function is_prime(n)\n"
