If it is, it increments the `depth` variable by 1. If it is not, it decrements the `depth` variable by 1. \n\nIf the `depth` variable ever becomes negative, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, so the function immediately returns `false`. \n\nIf the loop completes without returning `false`, the function checks if the `depth` variable is equal to 0. If it is, it means that the number of opening and closing brackets is equal, so the function returns `true`. If it is not, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns `false`. \n\nIn summary, the function checks if a string of brackets is correctly balanced by counting the number of opening and closing brackets and ensuring that they match up. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction correct_bracketing(brackets){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_45_triangle_area", "language": "js", "prompt": "function triangle_area(a, h){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_45_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = triangle_area;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(5, 3),7.5);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(2, 2),2.0);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(10, 8),40.0);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a tuple containing two elements, each of which can be either an integer or `nothing`.\n\n- `smallest = filter(x -> x < 0, lst)` creates a new array `smallest` by filtering the input array `lst` to include only elements that are less than zero.\n\n- `largest = filter(x -> x > 0, lst)` creates a new array `largest` by filtering the input array `lst` to include only elements that are greater than zero.\n\n- `return (isempty(smallest) ? nothing : maximum(smallest), isempty(largest) ? nothing : minimum(largest))` returns a tuple containing the maximum element of `smallest` if it is not empty, or `nothing` if it is empty, and the minimum element of `largest` if it is not empty, or `nothing` if it is empty. \n\nThe function first filters the input array to create two new arrays, one containing only negative integers and the other containing only positive integers. It then returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer, or `nothing` if either of these arrays is empty. The function uses the ternary operator `? :` to check if an array is empty and return `nothing` if it is, or the maximum/minimum element of the array if it is not.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. In this implementation, the sequence starts from 2 instead of 0.\n\nThe function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function signature specifies that `n` must be an `Int64` and the return value must also be an `Int64`.\n\nThe first line of the function initializes an array `results` with four elements: `[0, 0, 2, 0]`. This array stores the last four numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The first two elements are initialized to 0 because the sequence starts from 2 instead of 0. The third element is initialized to 2, which is the second number in the sequence. The fourth element is initialized to 0 because it will be updated in the loop.\n\nThe next line checks if `n` is less than 4. If `n` is less than 4, then the function returns the `n`th element in the `results` array. This is because the first three elements of the `results` array are already initialized to the first three numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe loop starts at 4 and goes up to `n`. In each iteration of the loop, the `results` array is updated with the next number in the sequence. The new number is the sum of the last four numbers in the `results` array. The `results` array is updated by shifting the elements to the left and adding the new number to the end.\n\nFinally, the function returns the last element in the `results` array, which is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence.<|im_end|>\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction fib4(n){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_37_sort_even", "language": "js", "prompt": "function sort_even(l){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_37_sort_even.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = sort_even;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3]),[1, 2, 3]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]),[-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10]),[-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This gives the number of containers required to hold the contents of the row.\n\nThe function then adds up all of these container counts to give the total number of containers required to hold the contents of the entire `grid` array.

The function returns a string that is the concatenation of `class_name`, a period, and the string in `extensions` with the highest \"strength\". \n\nThe strength of a string is calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the string. For example, the strength of the string \"JULIA\" is 5, while the strength of the string \"julia\" is -5.\n\nThe function begins by initializing the variable `strong` to the first element of `extensions`. It then calculates the strength of `strong` and stores it in the variable `my_val`.\n\nThe function then loops over the remaining elements of `extensions` using the `for` loop. For each element `s`, it calculates its strength and stores it in the variable `val`. If `val` is greater than `my_val`, it updates `strong` to be `s` and `my_val` to be `val`.\n\nFinally, the function concatenates `class_name`, a period, and `strong` to form the output string `ans`, which it returns. \n\nOverall, the function finds the extension with the highest strength and returns a string that includes both the class name and the strongest extension. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements", "language": "js", "prompt": "function find_closest_elements(numbers){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_20_find_closest_elements.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = find_closest_elements;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]),[3.9, 4.0]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0]),[5.0, 5.9]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]),[2.0, 2.2]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]),[2.0, 2.0]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]),[2.2, 3.1]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether there exists a triplet of integers in the vector `l` that sum up to zero.\n\nThe function uses a triple nested loop to iterate over all possible triplets of integers in the vector `l`. The outermost loop iterates over the indices of the vector `l` from 1 to the length of the vector. The second loop iterates over the indices of the vector `l` from the current index of the outer loop plus 1 to the length of the vector. The innermost loop iterates over the indices of the vector `l` from the current index of the second loop plus 1 to the length of the vector.\n\nInside the innermost loop, the function checks if the sum of the integers at the current indices of the three loops is equal to zero. If it is, the function immediately returns `true`. If the function has not returned `true` after all possible triplets have been checked, it returns `false`. \n\nOverall, the function checks all possible triplets of integers in the vector `l` to see if any of them sum up to zero. If such a triplet exists, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction triples_sum_to_zero(l){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_24_largest_divisor", "language": "js", "prompt": "function largest_divisor(n){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_24_largest_divisor.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = largest_divisor;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(3),1);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(7),1);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(10),5);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(100),50);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(49),7);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `for` loop is defined by the `for` keyword, followed by a variable `i` that is initialized to `n-1`, followed by the range `n-1:-1:0`. This range specifies that the loop should iterate from `n-1` down to `0`, with a step size of `-1`. \n\nInside the loop, the code checks whether `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is zero, then `i` is a divisor of `n`, and the function returns `i`. \n\nIf the loop completes without finding a divisor, then the function returns nothing (i.e., `nothing` in Julia). \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction largest_divisor(n){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_19_sort_numbers", "language": "js", "prompt": "function sort_numbers(numbers){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_19_sort_numbers.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = sort_numbers;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"\"),\"\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"three\"),\"three\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"three five nine\"),\"three five nine\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"five zero four seven nine eight\"),\"zero four five seven eight nine\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"six five four three two one zero\"),\"zero one two three four five six\");\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

This function checks if `n` is a prime number by iterating through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of the numbers, the function returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.\n\nThe function then iterates through all numbers from 2 to 101 (inclusive) and checks if each number is prime. If a number is not prime, the loop skips to the next number. If a number is prime, the function then iterates through all pairs of prime numbers from 2 to 101 (inclusive) and checks if the product of the two numbers multiplied by any other prime number from 2 to 101 (inclusive) is equal to the input integer `a`. If the product of the three numbers is equal to `a`, the function returns `true`. If no combination of three prime numbers multiplied together equals `a`, the function returns `false`. \n\nIn summary, the function checks if there exist three prime numbers between 2 and 101 (inclusive) whose product is equal to the input integer `a`. If such a combination exists, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction is_multiply_prime(a){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_120_maximum", "language": "js", "prompt": "function maximum(arr, k){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_120_maximum.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = maximum;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([-3, -4, 5], 3),[-4, -3, 5]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([4, -4, 4], 2),[4, 4]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1),[2]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([123, -123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3], 3),[2, 20, 123]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([-123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3], 4),[0, 1, 2, 20]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0], 7),[-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([-1, 0, 2, 5, 3, -10], 2),[3, 5]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 0, 5, -7], 1),[5]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([4, -4], 2),[-4, 4]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([-10, 10], 2),[-10, 10]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3, -23, 243, -400, 0], 0),[]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The goal with the explanation, is so that a reader can easily rewrite the program in JavaScript.\n\n### Julia version\n\nfunction encode(message::String)::String \n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    vowels_replace = Dict([(i, Char(UInt16(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])\n    message = map(c -> islowercase(c) ? uppercase(c) : lowercase(c), message)\n    return join([haskey(vowels_replace, i) ? vowels_replace[i] : i for i in message])\nend\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code is an implementation of a function called `encode` that takes in a string called `message` and returns a string. \n\n1. `vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"` - A string variable called `vowels` is created and assigned all the vowels in the English alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase. \n2. `vowels_replace = Dict([(i, Char(UInt16(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])` - A dictionary variable called `vowels_replace` is created and assigned a dictionary comprehension that creates a dictionary where each vowel in `vowels` is a key and the value is the character that is two characters away from the ASCII value of the vowel. \n3. `message = map(c -> islowercase(c) ? uppercase(c) : lowercase(c), message)` - The `map` function is called on the `message` string. The `map` function takes in a function and applies it to each element in the iterable passed in as the second argument. In this case, the function being applied is a lambda function that takes in a character `c` and checks if it is lowercase. If it is, it returns the uppercase version of `c`. If it is not, it returns the lowercase version of `c`. The result of the `map` function is assigned back to `message`. \n4. `return join([haskey(vowels_replace, i) ? vowels_replace[i] : i for i in message])` - A list comprehension is used to create a list of characters. For each character `i` in `message`, the list comprehension checks if `i` is a key in `vowels_replace`. If it is, it returns the value associated with the key in `vowels_replace`. If it is not, it returns `i`. The resulting list is then joined together into a string and returned as the output of the `encode` function. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction encode(message){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_42_incr_list", "language": "js", "prompt": "function incr_list(l){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_42_incr_list.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = incr_list;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([]),[]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([3, 2, 1]),[4, 3, 2]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]),[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `::Vector{Int64}` is a type annotation that specifies that the function argument `l` must be of type `Vector{Int64}`. \n\nThe function returns a new list that is created using a list comprehension. The list comprehension is enclosed in square brackets `[]` which creates a new list. The list comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying a transformation to each element. \n\nThe list comprehension in this code iterates over each element `e` in the input list `l` and applies the transformation `(e + 1)`. The transformed element is then added to the new list. \n\nThe `for e in l` part of the list comprehension is a loop that iterates over each element `e` in the input list `l`. \n\nThe `(e + 1)` part of the list comprehension is the transformation that is applied to each element `e` in the input list `l`. \n\nFinally, the `end` keyword marks the end of the function definition.\n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction incr_list(l){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_27_flip_case", "language": "js", "prompt": "function flip_case(string){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_27_flip_case.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = flip_case;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"\"),\"\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"Hello!\"),\"hELLO!\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"These violent delights have violent ends\"),\"tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS\");\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function counts the number of even and odd palindromes between 1 and `n`, inclusive.\n\nThe function defines an inner function called `is_palindrome` that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. The function converts the integer to a string, reverses the string, and compares it to the original string.\n\nThe function initializes two counters, `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`, to zero.\n\nThe function then loops through the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For each integer, it checks whether it is odd or even and whether it is a palindrome or not. If the integer is odd and a palindrome, it increments the `odd_palindrome_count` counter. If the integer is even and a palindrome, it increments the `even_palindrome_count` counter.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of the two counters, `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`.<|im_end|>\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction even_odd_palindrome(n){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_71_triangle_area", "language": "js", "prompt": "function triangle_area(a, b, c){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_71_triangle_area.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = triangle_area;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(3, 4, 5),6.0);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1, 2, 10),-1);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(4, 8, 5),8.18);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(2, 2, 2),1.73);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1, 2, 3),-1);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(10, 5, 7),16.25);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(2, 6, 3),-1);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1, 1, 1),0.43);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(2, 2, 10),-1);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns an array of 64-bit integers.\n\n2. `ret = Set()` creates an empty set called `ret` that will be used to store the common elements between the two input arrays.\n\n3. `for e1 in l1` starts a loop that iterates over each element in the first input array, `l1`.\n\n4. `for e2 in l2` starts a nested loop that iterates over each element in the second input array, `l2`.\n\n5. `if e1 == e2` checks if the current element in `l1` is equal to the current element in `l2`.\n\n6. `push!(ret, e1)` adds the current element in `l1` to the `ret` set if it is equal to the current element in `l2`.\n\n7. `return sort(collect(ret))` returns the sorted array of common elements between the two input arrays. `collect(ret)` converts the set `ret` to an array, and `sort()` sorts the array in ascending order. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction common(l1, l2){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_154_cycpattern_check", "language": "js", "prompt": "function cycpattern_check(a, b){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_154_cycpattern_check.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = cycpattern_check;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"xyzw\", \"xyw\"),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"yello\", \"ell\"),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"whattup\", \"ptut\"),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"efef\", \"fee\"),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"abab\", \"aabb\"),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"winemtt\", \"tinem\"),true);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `length(a) - l` is used to ensure that the loop doesn't go out of bounds when checking for patterns.\n\n5. `for j in 0:l` - This line starts a nested loop that iterates over the indices of `pat` from `0` to `l`.\n\n6. `if a[i+1:i+l] == pat[j+1:j+l]` - This line checks if the substring of `a` starting at index `i+1` and ending at index `i+l` is equal to the substring of `pat` starting at index `j+1` and ending at index `j+l`.\n\n7. `return true` - This line returns `true` if the condition in the previous line is true.\n\n8. `end` - This line ends the `if` statement.\n\n9. `end` - This line ends the nested `for` loop.\n\n10. `end` - This line ends the outer `for` loop.\n\n11. `return false` - This line returns `false` if none of the conditions in the loop are true.

The `::Int64` specifies that the input and output are 64-bit integers.\n\nThe first three `if` statements check if `n` is 0, 1, or 2, respectively. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 0. If `n` is 2, the function returns 1. These are the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nIf `n` is not 0, 1, or 2, the function returns the sum of the three previous numbers in the sequence.

The function returns the sum of the first `k` elements of the array, but only if the length of the integer is less than or equal to 2. \n\nThe `filter` function is used to filter out any elements in the array that have a length greater than 2. The `sum` function is then used to sum up the remaining elements. \n\nThe `filter` function takes in a function as its first argument. In this case, the function is an anonymous function that takes in a single argument `x` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the length of the string representation of `x` is less than or equal to 2. \n\nThe `arr[1:k]` syntax is used to slice the array from the first element to the `k`th element. \n\nThe `::Vector{Int64}` and `::Int64` syntax is used to specify the type of the arguments that the function takes in. `Vector{Int64}` specifies that the first argument is an array of 64-bit integers, and `Int64` specifies that the second argument is a 64-bit integer. \n\nFinally, the `return` keyword is used to return the sum of the filtered array. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction add_elements(arr, k){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_159_eat", "language": "js", "prompt": "function eat(number, need, remaining){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_159_eat.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = eat;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(5, 6, 10),[11, 4]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(4, 8, 9),[12, 1]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1, 10, 10),[11, 0]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(2, 11, 5),[7, 0]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(4, 5, 7),[9, 2]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(4, 5, 1),[5, 0]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a vector of two integers. \n\nThe function first checks if the `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`. If it is, it returns a vector containing `number + need` and `remaining - need`. If `need` is greater than `remaining`, it returns a vector containing `number + remaining` and `0`. \n\nThe function is used to simulate eating food. `number` represents the amount of food that has already been eaten, `need` represents the amount of food that needs to be eaten, and `remaining` represents the amount of food that is left. If `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`, the function returns a vector containing the new amount of food that has been eaten and the new amount of food that is left. If `need` is greater than `remaining`, the function returns a vector containing the new amount of food that has been eaten and 0, since there is no food left to eat. \n\nThe function is defined to take in arguments of type `Int64` and return a vector of type `Vector{Int64}`. \n\nOverall, the function is a simple implementation of a food-eating simulation. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction eat(number, need, remaining){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_113_odd_count", "language": "js", "prompt": "function odd_count(lst){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_113_odd_count.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = odd_count;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"1234567\"]),[\"the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\"]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"3\", \"11111111\"]),[\"the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.\"]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"271\", \"137\", \"314\"]),[\"the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 3n the str3ng 3 of the 3nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.\"]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

Initializes an empty array called `res`.\n2. Loops through each element `arr` in the input vector `lst`.\n3. For each element `arr`, it counts the number of odd digits in the string by doing the following:\n    - Converts each character in the string to an integer using `parse(Int, d)`.\n    - Checks if the integer is odd by checking if `parse(Int, d)%2==1`.\n    - Sums up the number of odd integers using `sum()`.\n4. Appends a string to the `res` array that describes the number of odd elements in the string and the index of the string in the input vector.\n5. Returns the `res` array. \n\nThe function uses the following Julia-specific syntax:\n- `::Vector{String}` specifies that the input is a vector of strings.\n- `push!()` is a function that appends an element to an array.\n- `string()` is a function that concatenates strings.\n- `[]` is an array literal.\n- `for ... in ... end` is a loop that iterates over each element in a collection.\n- `end` marks the end of a block of code.\n- `return` is a keyword that specifies the return value of a function. \n\nTo rewrite this program in JavaScript, we would need to replace the Julia-specific syntax with JavaScript equivalents. For example, we would use `[]` to create an array and `push()` to append an element to an array. We would also need to replace the `for ... in ... end` loop with a `for ... of ...` loop. Finally, we would need to replace the `parse()` function with `parseInt()`.

The function returns `'0'` if `i` is equal to `j`, and `'1'` otherwise. \n\nThe third line of the function definition uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `a` and `b` in parallel using the `zip` function. For each pair of characters, the `xor` function is called with the two characters as arguments, and the result is added to a list. The `join` function is then used to concatenate the list of results into a single string, which is returned as the result of the function. \n\nIn summary, the `string_xor` function takes two strings and returns a new string that is the result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on the corresponding characters of the input strings. The `xor` function is used to perform the bitwise XOR operation on individual characters, and the `zip` function is used to iterate over the characters of the input strings in parallel.

The array is created by applying the `string` function to a range of integers from `0` to `n`. The `.` syntax is used to broadcast the `string` function over the range of integers. This means that the `string` function is applied to each element of the range.

It does this by iterating through each character in the string and incrementing a variable `val` by 1 if the character is an opening parenthesis and decrementing it by 1 if the character is a closing parenthesis. If `val` ever becomes negative, it means there is a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis, so the function returns `false`. If `val` is 0 at the end of the iteration, it means all parentheses are matched, so the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe next two lines of code create two new strings `S1` and `S2` by concatenating the first and second strings in the `lst` vector in different orders. \n\nThe last line of code returns \"Yes\" if either `S1` or `S2` has matching parentheses, and \"No\" otherwise. The `||` operator means \"or\", so if either `check(S1)` or `check(S2)` returns `true`, the whole expression evaluates to `true`. If both `check(S1)` and `check(S2)` return `false`, the whole expression evaluates to `false`. The `?` and `:` operators are a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. If the expression before the `?` is `true`, the whole expression evaluates to the value after the `?`. Otherwise, it evaluates to the value after the `:`. In this case, if the expression before the `?` is `true`, the function returns \"Yes\". Otherwise, it returns \"No\". \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction match_parens(lst){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring", "language": "js", "prompt": "function filter_by_substring(strings, substring){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_7_filter_by_substring.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = filter_by_substring;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([], \"john\"),[]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"xxx\", \"asd\", \"xxy\", \"john doe\", \"xxxAAA\", \"xxx\"], \"xxx\"),[\"xxx\", \"xxxAAA\", \"xxx\"]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"xxx\", \"asd\", \"aaaxxy\", \"john doe\", \"xxxAAA\", \"xxx\"], \"xx\"),[\"xxx\", \"aaaxxy\", \"xxxAAA\", \"xxx\"]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"grunt\", \"trumpet\", \"prune\", \"gruesome\"], \"run\"),[\"grunt\", \"prune\"]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns a vector of strings that contain the `substring`.\n\nThe function is defined using the `function` keyword. The name of the function is `filter_by_substring`. The function takes in two arguments: `strings` and `substring`. The `::Vector{String}` and `::String` after the argument names are type annotations. They specify that `strings` is a vector of strings and `substring` is a string.\n\nThe function body consists of a single line of code. The `return` keyword is used to indicate that the function should return the result of the expression that follows it. The expression is a call to the `filter` function. The `filter` function takes in two arguments: a function and a collection. The function is defined using an anonymous function syntax. The `x -> occursin(substring, x)` syntax defines a function that takes in a single argument `x` and returns the result of calling the `occursin` function with `substring` and `x` as arguments. The `occursin` function returns `true` if `substring` is found in `x` and `false` otherwise. The collection argument is `strings`.\n\nIn summary, the `filter_by_substring` function takes in a vector of strings and a substring and returns a vector of strings that contain the substring. It does this by using the `filter` function to filter the `strings` vector based on whether each string contains the `substring`. The `occursin` function is used to check whether a string contains the `substring`. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction filter_by_substring(strings, substring){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_158_find_max", "language": "js", "prompt": "function find_max(words){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_158_find_max.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = find_max;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"]),\"string\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"]),\"enam\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\", \"cc\"]),\"aaaaaaa\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"abc\", \"cba\"]),\"abc\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"play\", \"this\", \"game\", \"of\", \"footbott\"]),\"footbott\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"we\", \"are\", \"gonna\", \"rock\"]),\"gonna\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"we\", \"are\", \"a\", \"mad\", \"nation\"]),\"nation\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"prrk\"]),\"this\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"b\"]),\"b\");\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([\"play\", \"play\", \"play\"]),\"play\");\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `by` keyword argument is used to specify the sorting criteria.

The `-` sign is used to sort in descending order.

The `min` function is used to get the smaller of the two arguments `a` and `b`, and the `max` function is used to ensure that the lower bound is at least 2.\n- `upper = min(8, max(a, b))` - This line sets the upper bound of the range of integers to be generated.

The first part of `x` is assigned to variable `a` and the second part is assigned to variable `b`. Similarly, the first part of `n` is assigned to variable `c` and the second part is assigned to variable `d`. \n\nThe function then calculates the numerator and denominator of a fraction using the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

The `::Bool` part specifies that the function returns a boolean value.\n\n`check = split(txt, \" \")[end]` splits the input string `txt` into an array of substrings using the space character as a delimiter. The `end` keyword is used to select the last element of the resulting array, which is the last word in the input string.\n\n`return length(check) == 1 && 97 <= Int(lowercase(check[1])) <= 122` returns a boolean value indicating whether the last character of the input string is a letter. The `length(check) == 1` part checks if the last word in the input string has only one character. The `lowercase(check[1])` part converts the first character of the last word to lowercase. The `Int()` function converts the resulting character to its ASCII code. The `97 <= ... <= 122` part checks if the ASCII code of the character is between 97 and 122, which are the ASCII codes for lowercase letters a and z, respectively. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_77_iscube", "language": "js", "prompt": "function iscube(a){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_77_iscube.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = iscube;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(2),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(-1),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(64),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(180),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1000),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(0),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1729),false);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

In this case, the function takes an integer of type `Int64`. \n\nThe second line of the function definition sets the value of the argument `a` to its absolute value using the `abs` function. \n\nThe third line of the function definition returns a boolean value that is `true` if the cube root of `a` rounded to the nearest integer and then cubed is equal to `a`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. \n\nThe `cbrt` function is used to calculate the cube root of `a`. The `round` function is used to round the cube root of `a` to the nearest integer. The `^` operator is used to raise the rounded cube root of `a` to the power of 3. \n\nOverall, the function checks if the argument `a` is a perfect cube. If it is, the function returns `true`.

The function takes two strings as input and returns a tuple of a string and a boolean. \n\nThe second line of the function definition removes all characters in the second string argument from the first string argument. It does this by using the `filter` function to iterate over each character in the first string and remove it if it is in the second string. The `!(x in c)` expression checks if the character `x` is not in the second string `c`. If it is not, then the character is kept in the first string `s`. If it is, then the character is removed from the first string `s`.\n\nThe third line of the function definition returns a tuple of two values. The first value is the modified string `s` from the second line. The second value is a boolean that checks if the modified string `s` is equal to its reverse. If it is, then the boolean is `true`.

The result is stored in a variable called `mean`.\n\nThe second line of the function calculates the sum of the absolute difference between each number in the input vector and the mean of the vector.

The function splits the input string into sentences using a regular expression that matches any of the characters `.`, `?`, or `!` followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The resulting sentences are stored in an array called `sentences`. The function then returns the number of sentences that start with the string `\"I \"`.\n\nThe first line defines a function called `is_bored` that takes a single argument `S` of type `String` and returns an integer of type `Int64`.\n\nThe second line creates a new variable called `sentences` and assigns it the result of calling the `split` function on the input string `S`. The `split` function takes two arguments: the first is the string to split, and the second is a regular expression that specifies the delimiter to use for splitting. In this case, the regular expression is `r\"[.?!]\\s*\"`, which matches any of the characters `.`, `?`, or `!` followed by zero or more whitespace characters. The `split` function returns an array of strings, where each string is a sentence from the input string.\n\nThe third line uses the `sum` function to count the number of sentences in the `sentences` array that start with the string `\"I \"`. The `startswith` function is called on each element of the `sentences` array using the dot notation `.` to apply the function to each element of the array. The `startswith` function takes two arguments: the first is the string to search, and the second is the prefix to look for. In this case, the prefix is `\"I \"`. The `startswith` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the string starts with the specified prefix. The `.` notation applies the `startswith` function to each element of the `sentences` array, resulting in an array of boolean values. The `sum` function then adds up the boolean values, treating `true` as `1` and `false` as `0`, to give the total number of sentences that start with `\"I \"`. This value is then returned as the output of the function.<|im_end|>\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction is_bored(S){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_14_all_prefixes", "language": "js", "prompt": "function all_prefixes(string){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_14_all_prefixes.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = all_prefixes;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"\"),[]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"asdfgh\"),[\"a\", \"as\", \"asd\", \"asdf\", \"asdfg\", \"asdfgh\"]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(\"WWW\"),[\"W\", \"WW\", \"WWW\"]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The function returns the sum of all odd numbers in the vector that are at odd indices. \n\nThe function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function `solution`. The function takes in one argument `lst` which is of type `Vector{Int64}`. The `::` operator is used to specify the return type of the function which is `Int64`.\n\nThe function returns the sum of all odd numbers in the vector that are at odd indices. \n\nThe `sum` function is used to sum up all the odd numbers in the vector that are at odd indices. The `sum` function takes in an array of numbers as an argument. \n\nThe array of numbers is created using a list comprehension. A list comprehension is a concise way of creating a list in Julia. The list comprehension is enclosed in square brackets `[]`. \n\nThe list comprehension iterates over the elements of the vector `lst` using the `enumerate` function. The `enumerate` function returns a tuple of the index and the value of each element in the vector. \n\nThe `if` statement in the list comprehension checks if the index is odd and if the value is odd. If both conditions are true, the value is added to the list. \n\nThe `x` in the list comprehension represents the value of each element in the vector. The `(idx, x)` represents the tuple returned by the `enumerate` function. \n\nFinally, the `return` keyword is used to return the sum of all the odd numbers in the vector that are at odd indices. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction solution(lst){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_126_is_sorted", "language": "js", "prompt": "function is_sorted(lst){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_126_is_sorted.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = is_sorted;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([5]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([3, 2, 1]),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([1, 2, 3, 4]),true);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The `all` function checks if the condition `lst[i-1] <= lst[i]` is true for all `i` from 2 to the length of the list (`length(lst)`). The `i-1` index is used to compare adjacent elements in the list. The `length` function returns the number of elements in the list. The `else` keyword is used to specify what to do if the condition is not true.

Store the sum in a variable called `N_sum`.\n3. `N_bin = string(parse(Int64, string(N_sum)), base=2)` - Convert the integer `N_sum` to a binary string and store it in a variable called `N_bin`.\n4. `return N_bin` - Return the binary string `N_bin`.\n\nIn summary, the function takes an integer `N`, converts it to a string, sums the digits of the string, converts the sum to a binary string, and returns the binary string. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction solve(N){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_129_minPath", "language": "js", "prompt": "function minPath(grid, k){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_129_minPath.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = minPath;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3),[1, 2, 1]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1),[1]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]], 4),[1, 2, 1, 2]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[6, 4, 13, 10], [5, 7, 12, 1], [3, 16, 11, 15], [8, 14, 9, 2]], 7),[1, 10, 1, 10, 1, 10, 1]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], 5),[1, 7, 1, 7, 1]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[11, 8, 7, 2], [5, 16, 14, 4], [9, 3, 15, 6], [12, 13, 10, 1]], 9),[1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[12, 13, 10, 1], [9, 3, 15, 6], [5, 16, 14, 4], [11, 8, 7, 2]], 12),[1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[2, 7, 4], [3, 1, 5], [6, 8, 9]], 8),[1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[6, 1, 5], [3, 8, 9], [2, 7, 4]], 8),[1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 10),[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate([[1, 3], [3, 2]], 10),[1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

It then initializes a variable `val` to `n * n + 1`. \n\nThe function then loops through each element of the grid using two nested for loops. If the current element is equal to 1, it initializes an empty array `temp`. It then checks if the current element is not in the first row, and if so, it pushes the element above it into `temp`. It then checks if the current element is not in the first column, and if so, it pushes the element to its left into `temp`. It then checks if the current element is not in the last row, and if so, it pushes the element below it into `temp`. It then checks if the current element is not in the last column, and if so, it pushes the element to its right into `temp`. Finally, it sets `val` to the minimum value of `temp`.\n\nThe function then initializes an empty array `ans`. It loops through the integers from 1 to `k`. If the current integer is odd, it pushes 1 into `ans`. Otherwise, it pushes `val` into `ans`. Finally, it returns `ans`. \n\nIn summary, the function returns an array of length `k` where the odd-indexed elements are 1 and the even-indexed elements are the minimum value of the elements adjacent to the 1s in the input grid. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction minPath(grid, k){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_100_make_a_pile", "language": "js", "prompt": "function make_a_pile(n){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_100_make_a_pile.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = make_a_pile;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(3),[3, 5, 7]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(4),[4, 6, 8, 10]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(5),[5, 7, 9, 11, 13]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(6),[6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(8),[8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.

The list comprehension is used to generate a sequence of integers that are added to the vector. \n\nThe sequence of integers is generated using the expression `n + 2*i`. This expression generates a sequence of integers that starts at `n` and increments by `2` for each subsequent integer. The sequence is generated `n` times, which means that the sequence will have `n` integers. \n\nThe list comprehension is enclosed in square brackets, which means that the resulting sequence of integers will be returned as a vector. \n\nThe function signature specifies that the input `n` must be an integer. The return type of the function is also specified as a vector of integers. \n\n\n### JavaScript version\n\nfunction make_a_pile(n){\n"}, {"name": "HumanEval_31_is_prime", "language": "js", "prompt": "function is_prime(n){\n", "doctests": "keep", "original": "../datasets/originals/HumanEval_31_is_prime.py", "prompt_terminology": "remove", "source_program": "keep", "target_signature": "keep", "tests": "}\n\nconst assert = require('node:assert');\n\n\nfunction test() {\n  let candidate = is_prime;\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(6),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(101),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(11),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(13441),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(61),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(4),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(1),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(5),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(11),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(17),true);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(85),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(77),false);\n  assert.deepEqual(candidate(255379),false);\n}\n\ntest();", "stop_tokens": ["\n}", "\n/*", "\n//", "\nconsole.log"], "translation_prompt": "You are an helpful AI assistant who understands all programming languages and can translate between them at ease.
