The function is implemented in Python. The function is designed to find the smallest integer that appears at least as many times as itself in the input list. \n\nThe function definition starts with the `def` keyword followed by the function name `search`. The input parameter is a list of integers called `lst`. The return value is an integer. \n\n```python\ndef search(lst: List[int]) -> int:\n```\n\nThe function creates a new list called `frq` with a length equal to the maximum value in the input list plus one. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the input list. The `+1` is added to ensure that the list has enough space to store the frequency of all the integers in the input list. \n\n```python\n    for i in lst:\n        frq[i] += 1;\n```\n\nThe function then iterates over the `frq` list starting from index 1. The loop checks if the frequency of the integer at the current index is greater than or equal to the value of the index. If this condition is true, then the answer is updated to the current index. \n\nFinally, the function returns the answer.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (search lst)\n"

The function returns \"YES\" if there are more even numbers in `lst2` than odd numbers in `lst1`, otherwise it returns \"NO\".\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\nThis line imports the List class from the typing module. The List class is used to indicate that the input arguments `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of integers.\n\n```python\nodd = 0\neven = 0\n```\nThese lines initialize two variables `odd` and `even` to 0.

The numerator is calculated by multiplying `a` and `c` together, while the denominator is calculated by multiplying `b` and `d` together.\n\nThe function then checks if the fraction represented by `x` and `n` is a simplified fraction. It does this by dividing the numerator by the denominator, and checking if the result is equal to the integer value of the result of the division. If it is, then the fraction is simplified, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (simplify x n)\n"

This formula is derived from the fact that there are 9 digits that can be used to fill the remaining `n - 2` digits after the first and last digits are fixed to 1. The first digit can only be 1, and the last digit can only be 1. Therefore, there are 9 choices for each of the remaining `n - 2` digits. This gives a total of `9 ** (n - 2)` integers that start and end with any digit. However, we are only interested in integers that start and end with 1. There are 2 such integers (11 and 1), so the total number of integers that start and end with 1 is `2 * 9 ** (n - 2)`. This can be simplified to `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (starts_one_ends n)\n"

The function is annotated with type hints to indicate the types of the input and output.\n\n```python\ndic = {\n    1: \"One\",\n    2: \"Two\",\n    3: \"Three\",\n    4: \"Four\",\n    5: \"Five\",\n    6: \"Six\",\n    7: \"Seven\",\n    8: \"Eight\",\n    9: \"Nine\",\n}\n```\nThis line creates a dictionary called `dic` that maps integers to their corresponding string values.\n\n```python\nnew_arr = []\nfor var in sorted_arr:\n    try:\n        new_arr.append(dic[var])\n    except:\n        pass\n```\nThis block of code creates a new empty list called `new_arr` and iterates over each element in the sorted array. For each element, it attempts to look up its corresponding string value in the dictionary. If the lookup is successful, the string value is appended to the new array. If the lookup fails (i.e. the integer is not in the dictionary), the exception is caught and the loop continues to the next element.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (by_length arr)\n"

The `bin()` function is a built-in Python function that converts an integer to its binary representation. The `[2:]` is used to remove the first two characters of the binary representation, which are always \"0b\". Finally, the string \"db\" is appended to the end of the binary representation.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (decimal_to_binary decimal)\n"

This is done by calling the `split` method on the input string with the separator '.'. The result is a list called `lst` which contains two strings: the file name and the extension. \n\nThe function then checks if the first character of the file name is an alphabetic character. If it is not, then the function returns 'No' because the input string is not a valid file name. \n\nThe function then counts the number of digits in the file name by creating a list of all the digits in the file name and then taking the length of that list. If the number of digits is greater than 3, then the function returns 'No' because the input string is not a valid file name. \n\nIf all the above conditions are satisfied, then the function returns 'Yes' because the input string is a valid file name.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (file_name_check file_name)\n"

The function checks if the string contains at least two nested square brackets.\n\nThe function definition starts with the keyword `def` followed by the function name `is_nested`.

The `->` symbol is used to indicate the return type of the function.\n\n```python\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if string[i] == '[':\n            opening_bracket_index.append(i)\n        else:\n            closing_bracket_index.append(i)\n```\n\n```python\n    closing_bracket_index.reverse()\n```\n\n```python\n    cnt = 0\n    i = 0\n    l = len(closing_bracket_index)\n    for idx in opening_bracket_index:\n        if i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]:\n            cnt += 1\n            i += 1\n```\n\nTwo variables `cnt` and `i` are initialized to 0. The length of the `closing_bracket_index` list is stored in the variable `l`. A for loop is used to iterate over each index in the `opening_bracket_index` list. If the current index is less than the index of the corresponding closing square bracket, the `cnt` variable is incremented and the `i` variable is also incremented.\n\n### Racket version\n\n#lang racket\n\n;; \n(define (is_nested string)\n"
